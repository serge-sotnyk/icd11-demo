DESCRIP TION:  
Allergy  is a form of exaggerated sensitivity  or hyper sensitivity, to  a substance that is e ither inhaled, 
swallowed, injected, or comes in contact with the sk in or eye.  A reac tion may be caused from exposure 
to polle ns, dust, molds, mite s, animal fur or dander, feathers, stinging insect venoms, foods , or drug s. 
The term all ergy is used to descri be situations where hypersensitivity results from heightened or alt ered 
reactivity o f the immune system in response to extern al substances.  Treatm ent typically consists of 
avoidance of the offending agent, medi cation or  immunotherapy . 
Injections of airborne or insect venom allergens  are prepared for each perso n individually.  
Aller gy testing can be broadly subdivided into two methodologies:  
In vivo testing  – includes skin allergy testing (i.e., skin prick testing, skin s cratch testing, i ntradermal 
testing, skin patch testing, a nd skin endpoint titr ation), bronchial provocation tests, and food challenges  
In vitro testing  – includes various techniques to test the blood for presence of spec ific IgE antibodi es to a 
particular antigen (i.e., RAST an d ELISA tests) and leukocyte histamine release test (LHRT), also referred 
to as basop hil hista mine release te st. 
Allergy immunother apy is the process of administering progressively increasing doses of an allergen as  
treatment for a person who has demonstra ted sensitivi ty throu gh allergy testing. The purpose of 
immunotherapy is to relieve t he allerg ic symptoms by decreasing the reactio n to the specific antigen . 
This clinical interven tion has been used over the past 80 years . Immunotherapy begin s with injections of 
the allergen extract (allergen vaccine) in low doses , with gradual increasing doses once or twice weekly 
as immunity to the antigen develops.  Upon reaching a maintenance dos e, injections are decreased to 
every two to six weeks, and may  continue for several years.  POSITION STATEMENT:  
Allergy Testing  
The foll owing allergy t ests meet the definiti on of medical necessity  when performed by or under the 
direct super vision of a physi cian for the purpose of establishing a  diagnosis of allergy di sease:  
 Direct nasal mucous membrane test  
 Ingestion challenge tes t (Exclud ing ingestion c hallenge food testing; refer to next section below )

The following types of allergy testing are considered experimental or investigationa l as cont rolled 
studies have failed to demonst rate the value of these tests for the diagnosis of allergies in cli nical 
practice.  This is not an all -inclusiv e list.

environ mental/c hemical hypers ensitivity disease, total allergy syndrome, cere bral allergy, 20th 
century disease)  
 Urine autoinjection (autog enous urine im munization)  
Routine al lergy re -testing does not meet the definition of medical necessi ty. 
Envir onment al therap y, also known as idiop athic environmental intolerance therapy  or clini cal ecology 
treatment, does not meet the definition of medical necessi ty as there is insufficient peer -reviewe d 
medical literature to support these therapies as b eing any more e ffective than the  standard care  for 
treatment.  
This method of therapy may incl ude the following:  
 Aerobic exercise therapy  
 Alteration of the individu al’s household environment  
 Environmental  care units  
 Neutralizing therapy of chemical and foo d extract s 
 Nutr itional t herapy  
Allergen Immuno therapy  
Allergen imm unotherapy by intradermal or  subcutaneous injection meets the definition of medical 
necessity  when admi nistered for the treatm ent of indiv iduals  demonstrating hypersensitivity to specific 
antigens th at can not be ma naged by  medications o r avoidance.  
Allerge n immunotherapy services may  include one or more of the following:  
 Individual  evaluation related to the  supply or administrati on of the allergenic extract (al lergen 
vaccine)  
 Supplie s (needl es, syringes, diluents)  
 Monitoring  the physical status of the individual  during administration of the extract (allergen 
vaccine.)

frequency and duration:  
 The build -up phase (also called updosing phase, induct ion phase or  dose -increase phase) 
involves receiving injections with incr easing  amounts of allerge n, and gener ally ranges from 1 to  
3 times per week. The durati on of this phase depends on the frequency of the injections but 
generally ranges from 3 to 6 mon ths (at a fr equency of 2 times and 1 time per week, 
respectively ). 
 Cluste r immu notherapy  is an acc elerated bui ld-up schedule that e ntails administering several 
injections at increasing doses  (generally 2 -3 per visit) sequentially in a  single day of treatme nt on 
noncon secutive days.  
 Rush immunotherapy is an accelerated immunothe rapy b uild-up schedule th at entails 
administering incremen tal does of allergens at inte rvals varying between 15 and 60 minutes 
over 1 to 3 days.  
 The maintenance dose or effective ther apeutic dose  is the dose that provides therapeutic 
efficacy with out signi ficant  adverse local or systemic reac tions; it may not be the initially 
calculated proj ected effective dose . 
 The maintenance phase begins when the effective ther aprutic dose is achiev ed; interval s 
between injections can be progressively increased as tolera ted to  4 – 8 weeks for ve nom, and 2 
to 4 weeks for inhalan ts. 
 Venom immunotherapy (VIT)  injections generally are given at weekly intervals.  
 VIT intervals between  maintenance dose inje ctions can i ncrease to 4 weeks the first year of VIT 
and eventua lly to ev ery 6  – 8 weeks  during su bsequent yea rs. 
 Clinical improvem ent is usually observed withi n one (1) year after the individual  reaches 
maintenance or effective thera peutic dose.  
 The decis ion to conti nue or stop  therapy should be made after 3 – 5 years . 
o Consider disc ontinuing  VIT after  3 – 5 years . 
o The duration of fir e ant immunotherapy has not b een clearly established, but most 
allergists recommend contin uing therapy 4 – 5 years.

DEFINITIONS:  
ALCAT:  antigen leukocyte cellular antibody) automated food allergy testing; is reported to identify fo od 
sensitivity by usi ng a modified  Coulter Counter linked to a computer program to mea sure the change  in 
white  blood cells i ncubated  with purified food a nd mold extract.  
Allergen:  any substance that indicates a state of, or brings on, manifestations of all ergy; an antigenic 
substance capab le of producing immediate -type hypersensitivity.  
Allergenic e xtract  (allerge n vaccine):  an extract  (allergen vaccine) o f allergenic components from a 
crude preparation of an allergen (e.g., weed, grass, mite, animal dander ) used for diagnostic  skin testing  
or for immunotherapy (hyposensitization) of allergy . 
Allergy : an o ver-react ion of the bod y’s immu ne system, against pa rticular substances and particles 
(allergens, antigens) such as pollen, animal dander, dust, insect par ticles.  
Antigen:  the specific part icle that one is allergic to, such as the specific p art of pollen. Antihista mine:  drug tha t blocks  the allergic reactio n. 
Asthma:  a reversible obstructive lung disorder characterized by increased responsiveness of the 
airw ays; inflammation and  irritation o f the airways that may cause wheezing, sneezing, cou ghing, or  
short ness of b reath.  
Bronchi al chall enge:  see provocation  test; involves the inhalation of agents that trigger respiratory 
responses (i.e., drugs causing airway  constriction, antige ns and chemic al sensitizers usually related to 
occupational breat hing prob lems).  
Conjunct ival challenge : see pr ovocation test; small  amount of antigen is applied to the lower 
conjunctival sac.  
Custer immunotherapy:  an accelerated build -up schedule that ent ails administ ering several injections at 
increasing doses (genera lly 2 – 3 per v isit) seq uentially in a  single day of treatment on n onconsecutive 
days.  The maintenance dose is generally achieved more rapidly than with a conventional (s ingle 
injection per v isit) build -up scheduled (generally within 4 – 8 weeks).  
Cytotoxi c testing : for determini ng sensitivity  to food s believed to cause a sthma, arthritis, constipation, 
diarrhea hypertension, obesity, stomach disorders, and many other condi tions; used in the 19 80’s; 
control led clinical studies have failed to demonstrate effe ctiveness  or re liability . 
ELISA (enzym e linked  immunosorbent assay) : an in vitro assay for allergen specific IgE antibodies in 
serum, indicating an allergy to the substan ce. 
FAST (fluorescent  allergosorbe nt test):  an in vitro assay using a fluoregenic dete ction sys tem th at looks 
for allergen s pecific IgE antibodies in ser um, indicating an allergy to the substance.  
Food challenge test:  used to confirm or diagnose IgE - media ted hypersensitivity to specific f oods, food 
additives and preservatives (metabisulfit e). Incre asing amo unts o f the suspecte d food a llergen is 
ingested e very 15  – 20 minutes for 2 hours or until a reaction occurs or the amount is higher than that 
expected to produce a reaction . One food it em is tested per day.  
Idiopathic environmental intol erance : The ori ginal ter m, clinical ec ology, w as replaced by the te rm 
multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS).  Most recently, it has been replaced by the term idiopathic 
envi ronmental intolerance , a term refl ecting the uncertain nature of the condition and its  relation ship t o 
chemica l exposure.  The centra l focus of the condit ion is the fact that the individual  describes recurrent, 
nonspecific symptoms referable to multiple org an systems that the s ufferers beli eve are provoked by 
exposure to low levels of chemic al, biolo gic, o r physica l agents.  The most com mon environmental 
exposures include perfumes and scented products, pesticides, domestic and industrial solvents, new 
carpets , car exhaust, gasoli ne and diesel  fumes, urban air pollution, cigarette smoke, plasti cs, and 
formald ehyde. Certain foods, f ood addi tives, drugs, electro magnetic fields, and mercury in dental fillings 
have also been reported as triggering events.  However s ymptoms do not bear a ny relationsh ip to 
established toxic effects of the specific chem ical and occur at concen trations far b elow tho se expected 
to elicit  toxicity.  
Immunotherapy:  allergy injection therapy; the process of injecting small amounts of substanc es causing 
the allerg y reaction; o ver a period of time, doses are progressively increa sed until  the b ody adjus ts to the subs tance, o r becomes desensitize d; other treatments include avoidance of the substance or taking 
medications such as antihistamines to block the allergic re action.  
In vi tro testing : within a glass or test tube; in an arti ficial en vironm ent. 
In vivo testing:  used to i dentify allergic subs tances that are responsible for producing diseases such as 
asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, urticaria , anaphylaxis, and ga strointestina l reactions.  
In vivo:  within the living body.  
Intrad ermal or Intrac utaneous test:  a small amount ( .001 to .05 ml) of an tigen extract (allergen vaccine) 
is injected into the skin with a disp osable syringe attached to a 26 - to 30 - gauge needle o r with a 
tube rculin type syr inge; a reaction is recorded 15 – 30 minutes a fter a pplicatio n. This type o f skin t esting 
is more suitab le to individuals  with lower skin sensitivity or for antigens with lower potency.  Because of 
the added risk of adverse syste mic reactions  due to the larger volume of antigen extract (allerg en 
vaccin e) use d, these tests are typi cally pe rformed on the upper arm or forearm rather than the back, to 
allow application of a tourniquet if necessary, and are perform ed in a setting with staff capable  of 
handling adverse reactions and emergencies.  
IP (Immuno -peroxida se test):  an in vitro a ssay for  allergen specific Ig E antibodies in serum, indicating an 
allergy to the substance.  
LEAP:  Lifestyle Eating and Performance d isease management pro gram (Don Sel f & Associates, Inc.) is 
based on the theory that sy mptoms of  irritable bowe l syndrome and  other c ertain conditions are  caused 
by reactions to specific foods and food additives.  The program includes individual  selection to ols, a self -
directed stress manage ment program, and assessment tools for determining o utcomes.  
MAST ( multiple thread allergo sorbent test):  an in vitro as say using an enzymatic detection system that 
looks for allergen specific IgE antibodies in serum, indic ating an allergy to t he substance.  
Mediator release test (MRT):  primarily used to dete ct intole rance to foods and additives in indiv iduals  
with irritable  bowel syndrome.  Also used in individuals  with chronic fatigue syndrome, metabolic 
conditions (e.g., di abetes, obesity), gas trointestinal  disorders (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
chronic ul cerati ve coliti s, and Crohn’s  disease ), neurologic disorde rs (e.g., migraine headaches, cluster 
headaches), rheumatologic disorders (inflammatory arthritis, arth ralgias, fibromyalgia ), otolaryngo logic 
disorders (e.g., perennial rhinitis, chronic s inusitis,  chron ic otitis  media with ef fusion),  dermatologic 
conditi ons (e.g., eczema, urticaria, dermatitis), and in individuals  with behavioral conditions (e.g., 
attenti on deficit disorder, hyperactivity , frequent mood swings, inability to concentrate).  This test 
measur es the ag gregate releas e of inf lammatory mediators f rom the individual’s  immunocytes in vitro 
after exposure to specific foods and food additives.  The resu lts of the mediator r elease test h ave been 
used to design a n individual -specific diet  to treat  irritable bowe l syndrome by avoiding  foods and 
additives that trigger significant inflammatory mediator release.  
Nasal challenge:  see provocation test.  
Patch (a pplication) test:  antigen is impre gnated into a small piece of gauze or filter paper d isc and 
applied  to a str ip of aluminum  foil or  placed within an 8 m m diameter aluminum device (Finn chamber) 
and applied to the skin and held in place with tape (a test s ystem known as the TR UE test uses multiple antigens incorporated into a gel delivery s ystem); r eactio ns are ob served and rec orded at  48 hours after 
appl ication and may be read again 1 – 5 days after the first reading.  
Prick or puncture test:  a drop of anti gen is placed directl y on the skin  then gently pricked through with a 
sharp instrument  (needle,  lance t, or spe cially designe d plasti c device) at a 45  – 60 degree angle (prick 
test) or 90 degree angle (puncture); reactions are recorded at 15  – 20 minutes af ter application.  
PRIS T (paper radi oimmunosorbent test):  an in vitro assay for allergen  specific  IgE a ntibodies  in serum, 
indicating an allergy to the sub stance.  
Proteolytic enzyme:  when preparing mixtures of allergen extracts, the prescribing physician mus t take 
into account t he cross -reac tivity of allergen extracts and the potential for al lergen de gradat ion cause d 
by proteolyt ic enzym es (breakdown of prot eins).  
Provocation test:  challenge test performed to duplicate the individual’s  main symptoms or signs by 
controlled exposur e to a suspec ted antigen; can be delivered by ingestion (food, or al challe nge), 
inhalatio n (bronchial c hallenge ), or by direct appli cation to the mucosal membrane of nares (nasal 
challenge) or conjunctiva (conjunctival challenge).  
RAST  (radio -allergo -sorbe nt test):  an in vitro assay for allergen specific IgE antibodies in serum;  
desig ned to ai d in the diagn osis of IgE-mediated disorder s and in the formulation of allergen 
immunotherapy.  
Rhinitis:  inflammation of the nasal mucosa.  
Rush im munotherapy:  an accel erated immuno therapy build -up schedule that involves administerin g 
increme ntal d oses of a llergen at int ervals v arying b etween 15 and  60 minutes over 1 – 3 days until the 
targeted therapeutic dose is achieved.  A rush immunotherapy sched ules for inhalant all ergens can be  
associated with a greater risk of systemic reaction s, partic ularly  in high -risk individua ls (e.g. , those with 
markedly  positive prick/puncture test responses), and premedication with antihistamines and 
corticosteroids app ears to reduce the ri sk associated  with rush immunotherapy.  
SAGE:  a cellular assay tha t tests f or del ayed food  sensitivity; the SAGE  method uses whole bl ood, rather 
than serum, and tests simultaneously for multiple pathways.  
Scratch tests:  the skin is supe rficially scratched w ith a blunt s carifying device in such a way as to prevent 
excessi ve bleedi ng; a drop of a ntigen extract  (allerg en vaccine) is then a pplied to the scratch; antigen 
and control sites are recorded 20 minutes after application.  
Skin test:  applying a small amou nt of an anti gen extract (allergen vaccine) directly to the skin either by  
intra dermal te sts or by epic utaneous , epidural, or percut aneous tests (scratch, prick, puncture, and 
patch tests).
