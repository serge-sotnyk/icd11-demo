Based on review of a vailable data, the Company considers the use of brand name PPIs when patient 
selection criteria are not met or for usage not included in the above patient selection criteria to be 
not medically necessary.**  
 
Background/Overview  
Proton pump inhibitors are commonly used anti -secretory agents that are highly effective at 
suppressing gastric acid and subsequently treating associated conditions, including gastroesophageal 
reflux disease. Of note, Prilosec suspension and Nexium granule s for suspension are both indicated 
down to 1 month of age.   
 
Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer -reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and acc epted standards of medical

practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines.  
 
The patient selection criteria presented in this policy takes into con sideration clinical evidence or 
patient history that suggests the available generic PPIs will be ineffective or cause an adverse 
reaction to the patient. This policy also takes into consideration whether or not a patient is able to 
swallow or whether or no t they have a feeding tube as well as the age of the patient. Based on a 
review of the data, in the absence of the above mentioned caveats, there is no advantage of using a 
brand name PPI over the available generic PPIs.  Generic drugs are considered to hav e equal 
bioavailability and efficacy in comparison to brand name drugs.  There is also no advantage of using 
Prilosec suspension over generic esomeprazole granules for suspension (or Nexium granules for 
suspension when the generic equivalent to Nexium gran ules is not available).

**Medically Necessary (or “Medical Necessity”) - Health care services, treatment, procedures, 
equipment, drugs, devices, items or supplies that a Provider, exercising prudent clinical judgment, 
would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, evaluating, diagnosing or treating an illness, 
injury, disease or its symptoms, and that are: 
A. In accordance with nationally accepted standards of medical practice; 
B. Clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, level of care, site and duration, 
and considered effective for the patient's illness, injury or disease; and 
C. Not primarily for the personal comfort or convenience of the patient, physician or other 
health care provider, and not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services 
at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or 
treatment of that patient's illness, injury or disease. 
For these purposes, “nationally accepted standards of medical practice” means standards  that are 
based on credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community, Physician Specialty Society recommendations and 
the views of Physicians practicing in relevant clinical areas and any other relevant factors.
