I. Aetna considers distraction osteogenesis (distraction histogenesis) 
medically necessary for the correction of functional impairments 
accompanying the following congenital craniofacial skeletal 
deformities: 
Cleft lip and palate;  or  
Correction of hemifacial microsomia, in children with suﬃcient 
bone to allow for a corticotomy and/or osteotomy and 
placement of pins for external or internal distraction devices 
(i.e., Pruzansky Grade I and IIa type mandibular deformity); or 
Correction of severe congenital mandibular deficiency  
requiring lengthening of the mandible of greater than 10 mm  
(orthognathic surgery is able to correct smaller mandibular  
deformities);  or  
Correction of severe micrognathia (such as accompanying 
Pierre Robin syndrome or Treacher Collins syndrome) in infants 
and children with airway obstruction; or 
Lengthening  of  a  short  mandibular  ramus  (stretching  of 
pterygomasseteric sling);  or  
Non -syndromic craniosynostosis – coronal (bilateral or 
unilateral) or sagittal; or

Syndromic  craniosynostosis  –  Apert,  Crouzon,  and  Pfeiﬀer  
syndromes;  or  
Widening of a narrow mandible or maxilla. 
Upon review by Aetna's Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMS) Unit, 
distraction osteogenesis may be considered medically necessary 
for correction of functional impairments accompanying other 
congenita l craniofacial anomalies where it is determined that 
distraction osteogenesis can uniquely produce a degree of improvement unavailable with other standard techniques. 
II. Aetna considers distraction osteogenesis experimental and 
investigational for acquired craniofacial defects (e.g., reconstruction of defects following tumor (e.g., osteosarcoma) 
resection, or ablative head and neck surgery), obstructive sleep 
apnea, and all other craniofacial indications because of insuﬃcient 
evidence regarding the clinical value of this approach for these 
indications. 
III.  Aetna considers enhancement of bone formation by means of bone morphogenetic proteins and local injection of bone marrow 
aspirate and platelet gel at the osteotomy site during distraction 
osteogenesis experimental and investigational because of 
insuﬃcient evidence in the peer -reviewed literature. 
IV.  Aetna does not cover distraction osteogenesis (distraction histogenesis) in preparation for dental implants or orthodontic 
care under plans that exclude dental implants or orthodontic care. Please check benefit plan descriptions. See CPB 0082 ­
Dental Services and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: Coverage 
Under Medical Plans (../1_99/0082.html). 
V. Aetna considers distraction osteogenesis for the sole purpose of  
improving individual appearance and profile cosmetic.

BACKGROUND 
Orthognathic surgery is the surgical correction of skeletal anomalies or 
malformations involving the midface, mandible and maxilla. These malformations may be present at birth, or may become evident as the patient grows and develops. Jaw malformations can cause chewing and 
eating difficulties, abnormal speech patterns, early loss of teeth, and 
disfigurement and dysfunction of the maxilla and mandible. Mal -occlusion 
may be caused by a deficiency or excess of bony tissue in one or both jaws, or by trauma to the facial bones. 
In orthognathic surgery, an osteotomy is made in the affected jaw, and the 
bones are repositioned in a more physiologic alignment. Generally, the 
bones are held in their new positions with plates, screws and wires. The 
patient may also need arch bars placed on both jaws to add stability (a procedure called intermaxillary fixation). For patients with deformities affecting both jaws, either simultaneous or staged osteotomies may be 
undertaken to achieve correction. Patients with deficient bone tissue may 
require grafts from their ribs, hips or skull. Alloplastic replacement of missing bone may also be required. 
Indications  for  orthogn
 athic  surgery  include:  (i)  mandibular  prognathism;  
(ii) mandibular  retrognathia; (iii) maxillary excess; (iv) maxillary  
deficiency;  and  (v)  apertognathia  (open  bite  deformity).  In  some  cases,  
adjunctive  procedures  such a  reconstructive  rhinoplasty,  malar  and  chin  
osteoplasty,  and  bone  grafting  are  needed  to  correct  deformities;  however  
these  procedures  require  evaluation  by  the  Oral  and  Maxillofacial  Surgery  
Unit  to  determine  coverage.  These  adjunctive procedures  are  typically  
considered cosmetic in  nature.

Distraction osteogenesis, initially developed by Ilizarov for limb 
lengthening has recently been applied to the correction of severe congenital or acquired craniofacial deformities as an early alternative to 
orthognathic surgery. Distraction osteogenesis involves the lengthening 
and re- shaping of deformed bone by surgical fracture and gradual 
separation of bony segments. The surgeon lengthens and re- shapes 
deformed bone by surgically fracturing the bone and slowly separating (distracting) the resultant segments with specially fabricated hardware. 
The bony fragments are held in place during the first week following 
surgical fracture to allow callus to form between the fragments. During the next several weeks, the fragments are gradually separated at a rate of 
1 to 2 millimeters per day, up to a pre-determined length (e.g., 20 days for 
20 millimeters or 5/8 inches). The bone segments are moved gradually to 
allow callus formation and adaptation of fibromuscular attachments. 
Once the desired length and shape is achieved, the hardware is left in 
place for an additional 6 weeks until the newly formed bone calcifies. 
The  specially  fabric
 ated  hardware  used  for  the  distraction  process  can  be 
internal  or  external.  Advantages  of  external  devices  include ease  of  
placement  and  removal.  In addition,  some external  devices  allow  multi - 
dimensional  control.  External  devices,  however,  are  very  conspicuous  
and  are  more  likely  to  cause  traction  scars  than  internal  devices.  Internal  
devices  are  less  visible  than  external  devices,  and  directly  transmit  force 
to  the bone.  Internal  devices,  however,  are  only  uni-directional  and  
require  a  subsequent  surgical  procedure for  their removal.  
The primar
y advantage claimed in connection with distraction 
osteogenesis is that it allows major reshaping of the facial bones without 
bone grafts or jaw wiring. Proponents claim that distraction osteogenesis 
may be safer than other methods of facial reconstruction, since it can 
involve less blood loss and a lower risk of infection. However, according to available literature, distraction osteogenesis has several drawbacks. If the bone ends are moved apart too slowly, callus may calcify too soon, preventing further distraction. If the bone ends are moved apart too 
rapidly, callus may be come too fibrous and fail to mature into solid bone. 
Therefore, the rate and rhythm of distraction is important to the quality 
and quantity of bone that is formed.

The published  literature  regarding  the effectiveness  of  distraction  
osteogenes is  for  craniofacial  anomalies  has  focused  on  its  use  in  repair  
of  congenital  conditions  in  young children.  The published  clinical  
literature  on distraction  osteogenesis  for  developmental  and acquired 
craniofacial  deformities  is  more  limited,  and consists  primarily of case 
series  reporting on i  ts technical feasibility, peri -operative  morbidity,  and  
short -term  outcomes.  Orthognathic  surgery  is  the  established  method  of 
correcting  developmental  mandibular  deficiencies,  maxillary  deficiencies  
and other developmental  and acquired craniofacial  deformities.  More 
investigation  is  necessary  to  refine  distraction  osteogenesis  technique,  to 
help  define  its  role  in  craniofacial  surgery,  and  to  improve  the  design  and 
reliability  of  distraction  devices  in  repairin g developmental  and  acquired 
deformities  in  older  children and adults  whose  growth is  at  or  near  
completion.  Moreover,  there  are insufficient  published  data  on  the long-  
term  effectiveness  of  this  procedure  for  these  indications,  especially  on  
the rate o  f  skeletal  relapse.  
According to a pos
ition statement from the American Association of Oral 
and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS, 2003), “the indications for 
distraction involving the jaws are limited to conditions in which this 
technique may be uniquely able to produce significant improvement over 
more traditional therapy.” According to the AAOMS (2003), examples of 
these situations are as follows: 
Narrow mandibl
e that must be widened. There has been little success 
in widening the mandible with conventional surgery prior to the advent 
of distraction. Distraction techniques offer a better way to address this 
problem 
Need  for  lengthening  of  a  short  mandibular  ramus.  According  to  the 
AAOS,  the nature of  distraction  osteogenesis is  well-suited for  
stretching  of  the  pterygomasseteric  sling,  which  is  not  easily  
overcome by conventional  procedures.  
Severe deficiency of either jaw with early correction indicated (e.g., an 
infant with Pierre Robin with mandibular deficiency so severe that 
tracheostomy is required and advancement of the mandible is the only 
way to correct an obstructive situation). 
Severe mandibu
lar deficiency requiring lengthening of the mandible of 
greater than 10 mm. Growth modification via orthodontics generally           
 
          
   
     
        
          
 
           
       
    
       
     
 
       
         
       
 
    
     
       
      
    
 
           
      
        
         
          
          
  
       
           
         
        
    
         Distraction Osteogenesis for Craniofacial Defects -Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna Page 6 of 21 
produces no more  than 5 mm differential growth and  conventional  
orthognathic  procedures  become  more  difficult  and  less  predictable 
when  greater  than  8  to  10  mm  advancement  is  needed.  
The AAOMS gui
delines also list alveolar deficiency among examples of 
established indications for distraction osteogenesis for craniofacial 
anomalies. However, there is insufficient published evidence of the effectiveness of distraction osteogenesis for vertical augmentation of the 
alveolar ridge in comparison with grafting techniques for this indication. 
The AAOMS guidelines list “[w]idening of the maxilla in an adult” among 
established indications fordistraction osteogenesis. However, surgically 
assisted palatal expansion, which is analogous to distraction 
osteogenesis, has been utilized to overcome this problem for decades with very desirable and stable results". 
AAOMS guidelines note that, “[a]s with any procedure, distraction osteogenesis should be utilized primarily when superior results can be 
achieved compared to conventional techniques” (AAOMS, 2003). 
Although the AAOMS guidelines do not distinguish between congenital and developmental and acquired conditions, the published evidence to date has focused on repair of congenital conditions. There is insufficient 
evidence of the effectiveness of distraction osteogenesis for 
developmental and acquired craniofacial anomalies. 
Schreuder et al (2007) noted that bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) 
and distraction osteogenesis are the most common techniques currently 
applied to surgically correct mandibular retrognathia. These investigators 
reviewed the literature on BSSO and mandibular distraction osteogenesis 
with emphasis on the influence of age and post -surgical growth, damage 
to the inferior alveolar nerve, and post -surgical stability and relapse. 
Although randomized clinical trials are lacking, some support was found 
in the literature for distraction osteogenesis having advantages over BSSO in the surgical treatment of low and normal mandibular plane angle 
patients needing greater advancement (greater than 7 mm). In all other mandibular retrognathia patients the treatment outcomes of distraction osteogenesis and BSSO seemed to be comparable. Dis traction 
osteogenesis is accompanied by greater patient discomfort than BSSO

during and shortly after treatment, but it is unclear if this has any 
consequences in the long-term. There is a need for randomized clinical 
trials comparing the 2 techniques in all types of mandibular retrognathia, 
in order to provide evidence- based guidelines for selecting which 
retrognathia cases are preferably treated by BSSO or distraction osteogenesis. 
Sacco  and Chepeha (2007)  s
 tated that  earlier  work  has  reported 
encouraging  results  regarding  the  translation  of  distraction  osteogenesis  
from  animal  studies  to  human uses,  with  particular  success  in  the  un- 
radiated  setting.  The major  challenge surrounding  the use  of  this  
technology  in  head  and  neck  oncological  reconstruction  will  be  the  effect  
of  radiotherapy  on  the  regenerate  bone  in  patients  who  have  received  or 
will  need radiotherapy  as  part  of  their  treatment.  Although distraction 
osteogenesis  provides  an  attractive  option  for  reconstructing  mandibular  
defects,  large  human studies  are  needed to further  evaluate  the  use of  
this  technology  and  its  role  in  the  treatment  for  mandibular  neoplasms.  
Ow  and Cheung (2008)  stated that  mandibular  distraction osteogenesis  
has  been used  effectively  to  treat syndromic craniofacial  deformities.  In  
recent  years,  its  scope  of  application  has  widened  to  include  treatment  of  
airway  obstruction  in  adults  and  children  as  well  as  non-syndromic  class  II 
mandibular  hypoplasia.  So  far,  there  has  been  no  evidence -based  review  
of  mandibular  distraction  osteogenesis  for  mandibular  lengthening.  
These  investigators  carried  out  a  meta- analysis  of  mandibular  distraction  
osteogenesis.  Two  rounds  of  searches  were  performed  by  2  independent  
assessors. The  first-round PubMed search  used the  keywords  
"mandible"  and "distraction osteogenesis". In the second- round search,  
the reference  lists  of  the  articles  were retrieved.  For  both  rounds,  
abstracts  and  then  full  articles  were  reviewed  and  selected  on  the  basis  of  
a  set  of  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria.  The  178  retrieved  articles  yielded 
1,185 mandibular  distraction  osteogenesis  patients:  539  received 
unilateral  mandibular  distraction  osteogenesis  and  646  received  bilateral  
mandibular  distraction osteogenesis.  Mandibular  distraction 
osteogenesis  was  reported  to  improve  facial  asymmetry  and  retrognathia  
(50.1 %),  correct  the slanted  lip  commissure (24.7  %),  and improve or  
level  the mandibular  occlusal  plane  (11.1 %)  in unilateral  asymmetry  
cases,  whereas  bilateral  mandibular  distraction  osteogenesis  was  shown 
to  be  effective  in  preventing  tracheostomies  for  91.3  %  of  neonates  or

infants with respiratory distress, and in relieving symptoms of obstructive 
sleep apnea for 97.0 % of children and 100 % of adult patients. The 
authors concluded that mandibular distraction osteogenesis is effective in 
treating craniofacial deformities, but further clinical trials are needed to evaluate the long-term stability and to compare the treatment with 
conventional treatment methods, especially in cases of obstructive sleep 
apnea or class II mandibular hypoplasia. 
In a retrospective medical review spanning a 9-year period, Kolstad and 
colleagues (2011) examined if there is a difference in mandibular 
distraction osteogenesis (MDO) treatment success rates and adverse outcomes in newborns, early infants, and older pediatric patients. Ten 
newborn (less than or equal to 35 days old), 5 early infant (36 days t o 5 
months) and 8 older pediatric (greater than 5 months) patients underwent 
MDO for treatment of micrognathia with a severe tongue- based 
obstruction. Success was defined as avoidance of tracheostomy or continuous positive airway pressure, and de- cannulation of patients with 
tracheotomies. Post -operative complications were grouped into minor 
and major. MDO successfully treated 90 % of newborns, 100 % of early 
infants and 100 % of older pediatric patients. There was no difference in 
the rates of success (p = 0.48), minor (p = 1.00) and major (p = 1.00) 
post-operative complications between newborns and early infants. Older 
pediatric patients had no treatment failures, tended to have fewer minor (p = 0.18) and significantly fewer major (p = 0.04) post -operative 
complications compared to younger patients. The distractor pin mobility 
(9 %) and scar revisions (13 %) were uncommon. The authors concluded that MDO is a reliable method for relieving severe tongue- based 
obstructions in pediatric patients. When comparing newborns and early 
infant patients, treatment success rates and the occurrence of complications were not found to be different. Older pediatric patients had no treatment failures, and tended to have fewer post -operative 
complicatio ns compared to younger patients. 
Pluijmers et al (2014) provided an overview of the surgical correction of the mandible in unilateral craniofacial microsomia (UCM) performed in the 
growing patient, and its long- term outcome and stability. The following 
databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of 
Science. Articles reporting prospective and retrospective studies of 
patients not older than 16 years (n ≥ 4) who had undergone surgical

correction of a craniofacial microsomia spectrum condition using grafts, 
osteotomies, distraction, or combinations of these, were reviewed. The period of follow -up was selected to be greater than or equal to 1 year. 
After inclusion, the articles were evaluated on short -and long-term 
outcomes, relapse, and any increase in asymmetry following treatment; 30 of 1,611 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Analysis of 
the surgical mandibular correction of UCM showed that the outcome is not so much treatment -dependent, but patient -dependent, i.e., deformity 
gradation- dependent. The type I and type IIa Pruzansky -Kaban patient 
had the best results with regard to minimal relapse and/or minimal increase in asymmetry. Single- stage correction of the asymmetry should 
be postponed until the permanent dentition stage. The authors concluded 
that in the treatment of the severely hypoplastic mandible, the patient will 
benefit from a multi -stage treatment protocol if indicated for functional or 
psychological problems. 
Tahiri  et  al  (2014)  st
 ated that  distraction  osteogenesis  is  an effective  
technique for  elongating  the  deficient  mandible.  These  investigators  
evaluated its  effectiveness in the treatment  of  airway  obstruction in  
pediatric  patients  with  mandibular  hypoplasia.  A comprehensive literature  
review  of  the  National  Library  of  Medicine  (PubMed)  database was  
performed. English-language s  tudies involving isolated distraction o  f the 
pediatric  mandible  (younger  than 18  years)  with  descriptive reporti ng of  
airway  changes  were included. Extracted data included demographics,  
initial  diagnosis,  distractor  type,  distraction  protocol,  pre-distraction  and 
post-distraction airway  status,  and complications.  A total  of  74 articles  
met the inclusion criteria,  resulting  in  711 patients  with  craniofacial  
abnormalities  who underwent  mandibular  distraction osteogenesis.  Mean 
age at  the time  of  distraction  was  18.1  months.  The most  common 
diagnoses  were  isolated Pierre  Robin  sequence (52.9  %),  syndromic  
Pierre Robin s equence (7 %),  and Treacher  Collins  syndrome (6.8  %).  
Mandibular  distraction  osteogenesis  successfully  treated airway  
obstruction in  89.3  %  of  cases.  Success  was  defined as  either  de- 
cannulation  of  tracheostomy,  avoidance  of  tracheostomy  or  continuous  
positive  airway  pressure,  or  alleviation  or  significant  improvement  of  
obstructive  sleep  apnea  (OSA)  symptoms.  A  total  of  171  (84.2  %)  of  the 
203 tracheostomy -dependent  patients  were  successfully  de-cannulated.  
Among  the  181  patients  with  OSA,  mandibular  distraction  osteogenesis  
successfully  allowed  for  either  complete  resolution  or  significant

improvement of symptoms in 95.6 %. A 23.8 % overall complication rate 
was noted. The mean follow -up time was 28.7 months. The authors 
concl uded that in addition to its positive effect on facial appearance, 
mandibular distraction osteogenesis is an effective procedure for the treatment of airway obstruction associated with congenital craniofacial defects involving mandibular hypoplasia in appr opriately selected 
patients. 
Bone Morphogenetic Proteins 
Sabharwal and colleagues (2011) not ed that delayed bone healing during 
distraction osteogenesis negatively affects clinical outcome. In addition to autologous bone grafting, several mechanical, chemical, biologic, and external treatment modalities may be employed to promote bone growth 
during distraction osteogenesis in the pediatric patient. Mechanical 
approaches include compressive loading of the distraction regenerate, increased fr equency of small increments of distraction, and compression-
distraction. Intra -medullary nailing and sub- muscular plating can reduce 
the time in external fixation; however, these techniques are associated 
with technical difficulties and complications. Exo genous application of 
low-intensity pulsed ultrasound or pulsed electromagnetic fields may 
shorten the duration of external fixation. Other promising modalities 
include diphosphonates, physician- directed use (off -label use) of bone 
morphogenetic proteins, and local injection of bone marrow aspirate and 
platelet gel at the osteotomy site. The author concluded that well -
designed clinical studies are needed to establish safe and effective 
guidelines for various modalities to enhance new bone formation during distraction osteogenesis in children. 
Terbish  and  colleagues  (
 2015)  evaluated  the  effect  of  recombinant  human  
bone morphogenetic  protein- 2 (rhBMP -2)  on  the quality  and  quantity  of  
regenerated  bone when injected  into distracted alveolar  bone.  A total  of  
16 adult  beagle dogs  were  assigned to  either  the control  or  rhBMP- 2 
group.  After  distraction  was  completed,  an  rhBMP-2  dose  of  330  μg  in  
0.33  ml  was  injected  slowly  into  the  distracted  alveolar  crest  of  the  mesial, 
middle,  and distal  parts  of  the alveolar  bone in  the  experimental  group.  
Histologic  and micro- computed tomography  analyses  of  regenerated 
bone were  done after  2  and  6  weeks  of  consolidation.  After  6  weeks  of  
consolidation,  the  vertical  defect  height  in  the  middle  of  the  regenerated

bone was significantly lower in the rhBMP -2 group (2.2 mm) than in the 
control group (3.4 mm) (p < 0.05). Additionally, the width of the 
regenerated bone was significantly greater in the rhBMP- 2 group (4.3 
mm) than in the control group (2.8 mm) (p < 0.05). The bone density and 
volume of regenerated bone in the rhBMP- 2 group were greater than in 
the control group after 6 weeks of consolidation (p < 0.001). The authors 
concluded that injection of rhBMP -2 into regenerated bone after a 
distraction osteogenesis procedure significantly increased bone volume in 
the dento- alveolar distraction site and improved both the width and height 
of the alveolar ridge and increased the bone density. These preliminary findings from a canine model need to be examined in human subjects. 
Distraction Osteogenesis of the Irradiated Craniofacial Skeleton 
Momeni  and colleagues  (2017)  stated that  craniofacial  DO is  a common 
treatment  modality  today.  Despite  its  numerous  advantages,  however,  
concerns  have  been  expressed  regarding  the  use  of  DO  in  the  irradiated 
setting. A systematic  review  was  performed to identify all  published  
reports  of  patients  who underwent  DO  of  the  irradiated craniofacial  
skeleton.  The following parameters  were of  particular  interest:  post- 
operative  complications,  specifically,  insufficient  bone  formation,  fracture, 
and hardware  exposure  (intra- oral  and  cutaneous),  as  well  as  the need 
for  additional  bone grafting.  The  initial  search retrieved a  total  of  183 
articles of which  20  articles  (38  patients)  met  pre-determined inclusion  
criteria.  The  most  common  site  of  distraction  was  the  mandible  (76.3  %). 
The median radiation  dose  was  50.7 Gy  (range of  30  to  70 Gy).  Bone 
defects   ranged from   30 to   80 mm  (median   of  42.5 mm).   Complications 
were  encountered in  19 patients  (50 %),  with insufficient  bone  formation 
being most  common (9 patients;  23 %).  The overall  incidence  of  
complications  was  not  significantly  associated  with  radiation  dosage 
(p = 0.79).The remaining  procedural  and  demographic  variables  also failed 
to  meet  statistical  significance  when compared against  the overall  
complication   rate  (p  = 0.27 to   0.97).   The authors   concluded that   the  
complication rate associated with craniofacial  DO  of  the irradiated  
skeleton  did  not  appear  to  be  substantially  higher  than  what  was  reported 
for  DO in the non  -irradiated setting.  As  such,  patients  should be  offered 
this  treatment modality, particularly in light of the fact, that it offers the  
option  to  decrease  patient  morbidity  as  well  as  treatment  complexity.
