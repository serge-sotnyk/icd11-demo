Introduction  
Infertility is a problem or problems with the reproductive system that affects the ability to 
conceive. Different types of reproductive problems affect men and women, but the end result is 
the inability to conceive or complete a pregnancy. There are many reasons for infertility and 
many different types of treatment s. Even though an infertility treatment exists, it  does not mean 
it is covered; the member’s contract determines this . (Services to diagnose infertility are  covered 
as a medical benefit.)  This benefit coverage guideline lists types of services that may be allowed  
if a member’s contract covers infertility treatments. 
 
Note:   The Introduction section is for your general knowledge and is not to be taken  as policy coverage criteria. The 
rest of the policy uses specific words and concepts familiar to medical professionals. It is intended for 
providers . A provider can be a person, such as a doctor, nurse, p sycholog ist, or dentist. A provider also can 
be a place where medical care is given, like a hospital, clinic, or lab.  This policy informs them about when a 
service may be covered.

considered medically necessary when performed solely to 
establish the underlying etiology  (cause)  of infertility.  
Infertility treatments  Once an infertility  diagnosis  has been established, infertility 
treatments may be allowed, dependent on the member’s 
contract. Infertility treatments may also be allowed, 
dependent on the member’s contract, for members 
undergoing or scheduled to undergo medical or surgical 
treatment w ith a significant likelihood of causing infertility. 
Listing of a service in the Assisted Fertilization Services  tables 
does not imply it is covered. Coverage is determined by the 
member’s contract. Refer to the member contract language for 
benefit determination.  
Sterilization reversal 
services Sterilization reversal services are generally excluded in the 
member’s infertility benefit and may only be allowed if indicated in the member’s contract. Listing of a service in the 
Sterilization Reversal Services  table does not imply it is 
covered. Coverage is determined by the member’s contract. Refer to the member contract language for benefit 
determination.

 Page | 8 of 11 ∞  Definition of Terms  
Impaired fecundity:  A woman is physically able to have a child but is unable to conceive a 
pregnancy or carry a pregnancy to live birth.1 
Infertility:  “Not being able to get pregnant (conceive) after one year of unprotected sex.”2 
Infertility is “ … the result of a disease (an interruption, cessation, or disorder of body functions, 
systems, or organs) of the male or female reproductive tract which prevents the conception of a 
child or the ability to carry a pregnancy to delivery.”3 
The rates of impaired fecundity and infertility in the United States in 2015- 2017 of women aged 
15–49 , reported by the National Center for Health Statistics: 1 
• Infertility rate among married women: 8.8% 
• Impaired fecundity among all women: 13.1% 
 
Description 
A variety of techniques are available to establish a viable pregnancy for couples who have been 
diagnosed with infertility and for whom assisted insemination has been unsuccessful.  
 
Background  
Infertility  
Infertility can be due either to female factors ( i.e., pelvic adhesions, ovarian dysfunction, 
endometriosis, or prior tubal ligation), male factors (i.e., abnormalities in sperm production, 
function, or transport , or prior vasectomy), a combination of both male and female factors, or 
other unknown causes.  
 
Treatment  
Various reproductive techniques are available to establish a viable pregnancy; different 
techniques are used depending on the reason for infertility. Assisted reproductive technologies 
(ARTs), as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other 
organizations, refer to fertility treatments in which both the eggs and sperm are handled. Not Page | 9 of 11 ∞  included in ART is assisted insemination (artificial insemination) using sperm from either a 
woman’s partner or a sperm donor. In most instances, ART will involve in vitro fertilization (IVF), 
a procedure in which oocytes harvested from the female are inseminated in vitro with sperm 
harvested from the male. Following the fertilization procedure, the zygote is cultured and 
ultimately transferred back into the female’s uterus or fallopian tubes. In some instances, the 
oocyte and sperm are collected, but no in vitro fertilization takes place, and the gametes are 
reintroduced into the fallopian tubes. Examples of ARTs include, but are not limited to, gamete 
intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), transuterine fallopian transfer (TUFT), natural oocyte retrieval with intravaginal fertilization (NORIF), pronuclear sta ge tubal transfer (PROST), tubal embryo transfer 
(TET), zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT), gamete and embryo cryopreservation, oocyte and 
embryo donation, and gestational surrogacy.  
The various components of ART and implantation into the uterus can be broadly subdivided into 
oocyte harvesting procedures, which are performed on the female partner; sperm collection 
procedures, which are performed on the male partner; and the in vitro component, ( i.e., the 
laboratory procedures) , which are performed on the collected oocyte and sperm. The final step 
is the implantation procedure.  
 
Regulatory Status  
There are no medical devices or diagnostic tests related to assisted reproductive technologies 
that require U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval or clearance.
