• Subacute rhinosinusitis – Symptoms for 4 to 12 weeks  
• Chronic rhinosinusitis – Symptoms persist greater than 12 weeks  
• Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis – Four or more documented and treated episodes of acute 
rhinosinusitis in a 12 -month period, with interim symptom resolution  
 
When indicated and appropriate, o ptimal med ical therapy should include also:  
• Allergy evaluation, education, and optimal treatment;  
• Decongestants;  
• Treatment of rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound nasal congestion due to extended use of 
topical decongestants);  and 
• Education on environmental irritants in cluding tobacco smoke.  
 
Balloon Ostial Dilation (BOD) used in combination with Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery 
(FESS)  
• BOD when used as a tool during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in the same 
sinus cavity is considered to be an integral part of the FESS procedure.  
• When BOD is used as an adjunct to FESS (defined as FESS on one sinus and BOD on 
another sinus in the same patient during the same operation) medical necessity criteria for 
BOD apply to the sinus being considered for BOD . 
 
Considerations for the use of BOD in children under age 18 years include the following:  
• FDA labeling for several 510(k) cleared devices includes use in children 17 years of age 
and under and is indicated to dilate sinus ostia and spaces associated with the maxillary 
sinus for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.  
• A 2014 AAO -HNS Clinical Consensus Statement on Pediatric Chronic Rhinosinusitis had 
near consensus on the safety of BOD in children but did not reach a consensus on efficacy.  
• American Academy o f Pediatrics Clinical Practice Guidelines only address the diagnosis 
and treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.  
 
For patients undergoing evaluation for surgical management of chronic sinusitis (either dilation or 
standard functional endoscopic sinus surgery), the CT scan on which the surgical plan and evaluation 
are based is typically performed within 90 days of the planned procedure.   CT scans beyond 90 days 
may be repeated, as both disease and anatomy may have changed.   CT scans older than 90 days may

rarely be used in adult patients when the symptoms and/or condition have not changed since the CT 
scan was obtained.  
 
When assessing for response to therapy and potential surgical candidacy for patients with chronic 
rhinosinusitis, CT scanning is typically indicated approximately 1-2 weeks following completion of 
aggressive medical therapy.  Imaging prior to this time may underrepresent patient response and 
overrepresent disease burden.  However, in certain circumstances, such as in lack of response to 
treatment or uncertainty of diagnosis, imaging may be indicated earlier in the treatment course or 
even prior to the initiation of treatment. 
 
Background/Overview  
The balloon ostial dilatation procedure involves placing a balloon in the sinus ostium and inflating 
the balloon to stretch the opening. It can be performed as a stand-alone procedure or as an adjunctive 
procedure to FESS. 
 
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by purulent nasal discharge, usually without fever, 
that persists for weeks to months. Symptoms of congestion often accompany the nasal discharge. 
There also may be mild pain and/or headache. Thickening of mucosa may restrict or close natural 
openings between sinus cavities and the nasal fossae, although symptoms are variable because 
considerable variation exists in the location and shape of these sinus ostia. 
 
Estimates are that approximately 30 million individuals in the United States suffer from chronic 
sinusitis. Most cases are treated with medical therapy, but surgical drainage is an option for patients 
who fail to respond to medical therapy. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery has become an 
important aspect for surgical management of chronic sinusitis. For this procedure, a fiberoptic nasal 
endoscope is used to visualize the sinus ostia, and any obstruction found is corrected. This procedure 
restores patency and allows air and mucous transport through the natural ostium. Approximately 
350,000 FESS procedures are done each year in the United States for chronic sinusitis. 
 
A newer procedure, balloon ostial dilatation can be used as an alternative to FESS or as an adjunct 
to FESS for those with chronic sinusitis. The goal of this technique, when used as an alternative to 
FESS, is to achieve improved sinus drainage using a less invasive approach. When used as an adjunct

to FESS, it is intended to facilitate and/or increase access to the sinuses. The pro cedure involves 
placing a guidewire in the sinus ostium, advancing a balloon over the guidewire, and then stretching 
the opening by inflating the balloon. The guidewire location is confirmed with fluoroscopy or with 
direct transillumination of the targeted sinus cavity. General anesthesia may be needed for this 
procedure to minimize patient movement. 
 
The maxillary sinus creates a unique challenge. The maxillary ostia, located within the ethmoid 
infundibulum, often cannot be accessed transnasally without excising a portion of the uncinate 
process. An alternate approach to the maxillary ostia is through the sinus, via the canine fossa. A 
guidewire can be advanced from within the maxillary sinus to the nasal fossa.  The dilating balloon 
can enlarge the ostia while deflecting the uncinate process. 
 
Recently marketed reusable stainless steel dilators (e.g. Simplicity®‡ Dilators) may be comparable 
to balloon ostial dilators, however published evidence is insufficient at this time to support long-
term efficacy and safety with their use, and confirm appropriate patient selection. In addition, there 
is not enough data comparing these reusable dilators to balloon dilation catheters cleared by FDA.  
 
FDA or Other Governmental Regulatory Approval  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
In 2008, the Relieva™‡ Sinus Balloon Catheter (Acclarent, Menlo Park, CA) was cleared for 
marketing by the U.S. FDA through the 510(k) process. FDA determined that this device was 
substantially equivalent to existing devices for use in dilating the sinus ostia and paranasal spaces in 
adults and maxillary sinus spaces in children. Subsequent devices developed by Acclarent have also 
been cleared by FDA through the 510(k) process. They include the Relieva Spin Sinus Dilation 
System®‡ (cleared in 2011) and the Relieva Seeker Balloon Sinuplasty System®‡ (cleared in 2012). 
 
In 2008, the FinESS™‡ Sinus Treatment (Entellus Medical, Maple Grove, MN) was cleared for 
marketing by FDA through the 510(k) process. The indication noted is to access and treat the 
maxillary ostia/ethmoid infundibulum in adults using a transantral approach (FDA product code: 
EOB). The bony sinus outflow tracts are remodeled by balloon displacement of adjacent bone and 
paranasal sinus structures. Two other balloon sinus ostial dilation devices, the ENTrigue®‡ Sinus

Dilation System (ENTrigue Surgical, acquired by more recently by Smith & Nephew), and the 
XprESS™‡ Multi-Sinus Dilation Tool, also received 510(k) clearance in 2012. 
 
In 2013, a sinus dilation system (Medtronic Xomed, Jacksonville, FL), later named the NuVent™‡ 
EM Balloon Sinus Dilation System, was cleared for marketing by FDA through the 510(k) process 
for use in conjunction with a Medtronic computer-assisted surgery system when surgical navigation 
or image-guided surgery may be necessary to locate and move tissue, bone, or cartilaginous tissue 
surrounding the drainage pathways of the frontal, maxillary, or sphenoid sinuses. 
 
Also in 2013, a sinus dilation system (Smith & Nephew), later named the Ventera™‡ Sinus Dilation 
System, was cleared for marketing through the 510(k) process to access and treat the frontal recesses, 
sphenoid sinus ostia, and maxillary ostia/ethmoid infundibula in adults using a transnasal approach. 
Ventera™‡Sinus Dilation System does not require a guide wire or an illumination system as it is 
intended for use as a tool in combination with endoscopic sinus surgery.

American A cademy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery et al  
In 2018, the American Academy of Otolaryngology —Head and Neck Surgery (AAO -HNS) 
published a clinical consensus statement on balloon dilation of the sinuses. Participating subgroups 
included the Triolog ic Society, the American Rhinologic Society, the American Academy of 
Otolaryngic Allergy, and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. The expert 
panel used Delphi method surveys to assess consensus on proposed statements. Statements achieving  
a mean score of 7.00 or higher and having no more than 1 outlier (2 or more LIkert points from the 
mean in either direction) met criteria for consensus. Strong consensus was defined as a mean Likert 
score of 8.00 or higher with no outliers. The following statements met consensus; statements 
reaching strong consensus are highlighted.  The updated information to guideline statement can be 
found on the AAO -HNS website dated April, 2021.  
 
Patient Criteria:  
• Balloon dilation is not appropriate for patients who ar e without both sinonasal symptoms 
and positive findings on CT. (Strong consensus)  
• Balloon dilation is not appropriate for the management of headache in patients who do not 
otherwise meet the criteria for chronic sinusitis or recurrent acute sinusitis. (Strong 
consensus)  
• Balloon dilation is not appropriate for the management of sleep apnea in patients who do 
not otherwise meet the criteria for chronic sinusitis or recurrent acute sinusitis. (Strong 
consensus)  
• CT scanning of the sinuses is a requirement before balloon dilation can be performed. 
(Strong consensus)  
• Balloon dilation is not appropriate for patients with sinonasal symptoms and a CT that does 
not show evidence of sinonasal disease.  
• Balloon dilation can be appropriate as an adjunct p rocedure to FESS in patients with 
chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps.

• There can be a role for balloon dilation in patients with persistent sinus disease who have 
had previous sinus surgery.  
• There is a role for balloon sinus dilation in managing patient s with recurrent acute sinusitis 
as defined in the AAO -HNSF guideline based on symptoms and CT evidence of ostial 
occlusion and mucosal thickening.  
 
Perioperative Considerations:  
• Surgeons who consider reusing devices intended for dilation of the sinuses sh ould 
understand the regulations set forth by the FDA for reprocessing such devices and ensure 
that they are followed. (Strong consensus)  
• Balloon dilation can be performed under any setting as long as proper precautions are taken 
and appropriate monitoring is performed.  
• Balloon dilation can be performed under local anesthesia with or without sedation.  
 
Outcome:  
• Balloon dilation can improve short -term quality -of-life outcomes in patients with limited 
CRS without polyposis.  
• Balloon dilation can be effective in  frontal sinusitis.  
 
The AAO-HNS updated its statement on balloon ostial dilation, reaffirming its 2010 position 
statement: “Sinus ostial dilation … is a therapeutic option for selected patient with chronic 
rhinosinusitis…. This approach may be used alone. .. or in conjunction with other 
instruments….” (Most recent revision with references added, 4/13/2021) 
 
In 2015, the Academy’s Foundation updated its 2007 clinical practice guidelines on adult sinusitis, 
which do not discuss surgical therapy or use of balloon sinuplasty.  
 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  
In 2008, a guidance on balloon catheter dilation of paranasal sinus ostia from the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) stated:  
• "Current evidence on the short -term efficacy of balloon catheter dilation of paranasal sinus 
ostia for chronic sinusitis is adequate and raises no major safety concerns.

• This procedure should only be carried out by surgeons with experience of complex sinus 
surgery, and specific tr aining in both the procedure and the use of fluoroscopy.  
• Publication of long -term outcomes will be helpful in guiding the future use of this 
technique. NICE may review the procedure upon publication of further evidence."   
 
In 2016, NICE published a recommendation on the use of the XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation System 
for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis: 
 
1.1 “The case for adopting the XprESS multi -sinus dilation system for treating uncomplicated 
chronic sinusitis after medical treatment has failed is supported by the evidence. Treatment with 
XprESS leads to a rapid and sustained improvement in chronic symptoms, fewer acute episodes and 
improved quality of life which is comparable to FESS. 
 
1.2 XprESS should be considered in patients with uncomplicated chronic sinusitis who do not have 
severe nasal polyposis. In these patients, XprESS works as well as FESS, is associated with faster 
recovery times, and can more often be done under local anaesthesia.”  
 
The recommendation was based on the results of the REMODEL study: the committee "considered 
that the evidence from REMODEL demonstrated that balloon dilation (with either XprESS or 
FinESS) is clinically non-inferior to FESS in terms of alleviating symptoms in patients with 
uncomplicated chronic sinusitis." Single-arm observational studies were of lower quality but were 
consistent with the findings of the REMODEL study.  This guidance was reaffirmed in July 2020. 
 
American Rhinologic Society  
A position statement, revised in 2017, from the American Rhinologic Society, stated that sinus ostial  
dilation is “a therapeutic option for selected patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) … who have 
failed appropriate medical therapy.”

*Investigational – A medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product is 
Investigational if the effectiveness has not been clearly tested and it has not been incorporated into 
standard medical practice. Any determination we make that a medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is Investigational will be based on a consideration of the following: 
A. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product can be 
lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
whether such approval has been granted at the time the medical treatment, procedure, drug , 
device, or biological product is sought to be furnished; or 
B. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product requires 
further studies or clinical trials to determine its maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, safety, 
effectiveness, or effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or 
diagnosis, must improve health outcomes, according to the consensus of opinion among 
experts as shown by reliable evidence, including: 
1. Consultation with technology evaluation center(s); 
2. Credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community; or 
3. Reference to federal regulations. 
 
**Medically Necessary (or “Medical Necessity”) - Health care services, treatment, procedures, 
equipment, drugs, devices, items or supplies that a Provider, exercising prudent clinical judgment, 
would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, evaluating, diagnosing or treating an illness, 
injury, disease or its symptoms, and that are: 
A. In accordance with nationally accepted standards of medical practice; 
B. Clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, level of care, site and duration, 
and considered effective for the patient's illness, injury or disease; and 
C. Not primarily for the personal comfort or convenience of the patient, physician or other 
health care provider, and not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services 
at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or 
treatment of that patient's illness, injury or disease.
