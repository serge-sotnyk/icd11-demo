Content
: 
1. PURPOSE
To define the medical appropriateness of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Drug
Products. 
To define the prior authorization guidelines for Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)
Drug Products.
2. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this policy is to provide general information applicable to the
administration of outpatient prescription drug benefits that Horizon NJ Health
administers for the NJ Family Care/Medicaid members. 
This policy applies to the Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare plans issued and/or
administered by Horizon Healthcare Services, Inc. d/b/a Horizon Blue Cross
Blue Shield of New Jersey and/or its affiliates, including Horizon Healthcare of
New Jersey, Inc. d/b/a Horizon NJ Health (collectively â€œHorizonâ€
​
).
If a memberâ€™s contract benefits, as set forth in the NJ Medicaid State
Contract differ from a pharmacy policy, the Contract prevails. 
Applicable
Federal and/or State regulations must be considered in the determinations.
Although a prescription drug may be medically necessary, it may be subject to
limitations and/or exclusions under a memberâ€™s benefit plan. 
If a
prescription drug is not covered and the member proceeds to obtain the
prescription drug, the member may be responsible for the cost. Decisions
regarding treatment and treatment plans are the responsibility of the physician.
This policy is not intended to direct the course of clinical care a physician
provides to a member, and does not replace a physicianâ€™s or
pharmacistâ€™s independent professional clinical judgment or duty to exercise
special knowledge and skill in the treatment of Horizon NJ Health members.
Horizon NJ Health is not responsible for, does not provide, and does not hold
itself out as a provider of medical care. 
The physician remains responsible for
the quality and type of health care services provided to a Horizon NJ Health
member.
Horizon NJ Healthâ€™s Pharmacy Policies do not constitute medical
advice, authorization, certification, approval, explanation of benefits, offer
of coverage, contract or guarantee of payment.
POLICY STATEMENT: This policy defines the scope and process of Hereditary
Angioedema (HAE) Drug Products coverage for Horizon NJ Health members.
This policy ensures that Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Drug Products are used
for FDA-approved indications and medically appropriate â€œoff-labelâ€
​
 uses
at appropriate dosages for the purposes listed below. 
The prior authorization
process will begin when providers or members initially contact Horizon NJ
Health for pre-approval. 
Clinical information will be attempted to be obtained in
a timely basis after initiation of the prior authorization request. 
Clinical
decisions regarding approvals will be made by the clinical staff while clinical
decisions for denials will only be made by the medical directors. 
Providersand/or members will be notified regarding final decisions.
Pharmacy Policies can be highly technical and are designed for use by the
Horizon NJ Health professional staff in making coverage determinations.
Members referring to a Horizon NJ Health pharmacy policy should discuss it
with their treating physician or pharmacist, and should refer to their specific
benefit plan for the terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions of their
coverage.
Horizon NJ Healthâ€™s Pharmacy Policies are proprietary. 
They may be used
only as authorized by Horizon NJ Health and its owner or affiliates.

contents of the Horizon NJ Health Pharmacy Policies are not to be copied,
reproduced or circulated to other parties without the express written consent of
Horizon NJ Health. 
The contents of these Pharmacy Policies may be updated
or changed without notice, unless otherwise required by law and/or regulation.
Benefit determinations are made in the context of policies existing at the time of
the decision and are not subject to later revision as the result of a change in
policy. 
This policy was developed in accordance with applicable Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines, the NJ Medicaid Managed Care
Contract, applicable NJ State and Federal Guidelines, and national
accreditation standards. This policy will be reviewed annually, revising
procedures as necessary to reflect changes to specific guidelines. 
The Director of Pharmacy or his/her designee will conduct an annual review of
this policy and procedure to ensure that it is still relevant and compliant with
appropriate New Jersey State and Federal Medicaid regulatory and accrediting
requirements, and accurately reflects current operations.

Therapeutics (P&T) committee on an annual basis approvals/denials of
medications requiring prior authorization. 
In addition, a quarterly report of
denials is generated by the Pharmacy Department and submitted to DMAHS.
Pharmacists are audited and are provided feedback on prior authorization
request performance on a quarterly basis to ensure that approvals and
recommendations for denials are done in accordance with policy criteria. 
The
pharmacy call center staff is audited and provided feedback on prior
authorization request performance on a monthly basis to ensure that correct
information is being captured and entered into that pharmacy system on a
timely basis. 
Medical Directors are audited annually on interrator reliability
concerning pharmacy cases.

3.3.
 
POLICY DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS
This Horizon NJ Health Pharmacy Policy has been developed by Horizon NJ
Healthâ€™s Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and Quality Improvement
Committee, which include practicing physicians and pharmacists. 
The Policy is
consistent with generally accepted standards of medical and pharmacy
practice, and reflects Horizon NJ Healthâ€™s view of the subject prescription
drugs, and in what circumstances they are deemed to be medically necessary
or experimental/ investigational in nature. 
The Pharmacy Policy also considers,
in part, whether and to what degree the subject prescription drug is clinicallyappropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, site and duration and if they
are considered effective for the illnesses, injuries or diseases discussed.
Where relevant, this Pharmacy Policy considers whether the subject
prescription drug is being requested primarily for the convenience of the
covered person or the health care provider. 
It also considers whether the
prescription drug ordered is more costly than an alternative, equally effective
prescription drug that is at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or
diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or treatment of the relevant illness, injury
or disease. 
In reaching its conclusion regarding what it considers to be the
generally accepted standards of medical and pharmacy practice, the Pharmacy
and Therapeutics Committee reviews and considers the following: 
all credible
scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally
recognized by the relevant medical community, physician and health care
provider specialty society recommendations, the views of physicians,
pharmacists and health care providers practicing in relevant clinical areas
(including, but not limited to, the prevailing opinion within the appropriate
specialty), the findings and directives of the Food and Drug Administration, 
and
any other relevant factor as determined by applicable State and Federal laws
and regulations.
