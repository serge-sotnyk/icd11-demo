1/22/2021 Aetna considers continued therapy with crizanlizumab-tmca 
(Adakveo) medically necessary when the member has 
experienced a reduction in the frequency of vasoocclusive crises, or has maintained such reduction, since initiating 
therapy with Adakveo. 
Aetna considers crizanlizumab (Adakveo) experimental and 
investigational for all other indications. 
Dosing Recommendations 
Administer Adakveo 5 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over a 
period of 30 minutes at Week 0, Week 2, and every 4 weeks 
thereafter.

Background 
U.S. Food and Drug  Administration (FDA)-Approved  
Indications 
▪Adakveo is indicated to reduce the frequency of 
vasoocclusive crises (VOCs) in adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with sickle cell disease. 
Sickle cell disease is a Mendelian recessive disorder  
comprised of a group of disorders that affects hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to cells 
throughout the body. People with this disorder have atypical 
hemoglobin molecules called hemoglobin S, which can distort 
red blood cells into a sickle, or crescent shape. Clinically, 
sickle cell disease is manifested most often by acute painful episodes or "crises" but with many other acute and chronic 
complications including a variety of serious organ system

1/22/2021 complications, life-long disabilities and even death. When red 
blood cells sickle, they break down prematurely, leading to 
hemolytic anemia. Vaso-occlusion (previously called sickle cell crisis) occur when the stiff and inflexible sickled red blood cells 
get stuck in small blood vessels, resulting in recurrent painful 
episodes (previously called sickle cell crisis) and a variety of 
serious organ system complications which can lead to life-long 
disabilities and even death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sickle cell disease affects 
approximately 100,000 Americans. The disease occurs most 
often in African-Americans, where 1 out of every 365 babies 
born have the disease. The management of acute pain in 
individuals with sickle cell disease (SCT) is divided into 
prevention of pain, treatment of acute pain episodes, and 
management of chronic pain. Prophylactic pain management includes reducing pain triggers such as exposure to cold 
temperature or respiratory triggers, dehydration, and 
overexertion. Hydroxyurea and L-glutamine are the two main 
pharmacotherapy options for reducing pain episodes. Other 
pain management options include non-opioid (e.g., acetaminophen and NSAIDs) and opioid treatment. 
On November 15, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration approved Adakveo (crizanlizumab-tmca) for 
patients age 16 years and older to reduce the frequency of 
vaso-occlusive crisis, a common and painful complication of 
sickle cell disease that occurs when blood circulation is obstructed by sickled red blood cells. Crizanlizumab-tmca is 
the first targeted therapy approved for sickle cell disease. 
Crizanlizumab-tmca is a selectin blocker humanized IgG2 
kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to P-selectin and blocks 
interactions with its ligands including P-selectin glycoprotein 
ligand 1. Binding P-selectin on the surface of the activated 
endothelium and platelets blocks interactions between endothelial cells, platelets, red blood cells, and leukocytes.

1/22/2021 The crizanlizumab-tmca approval was based on  the results of 
a randomized clinical trial enrolling 198 patients with sickle cell 
disease with a history of vaso-occlusive crisis (Ataga et al.; SUSTAIN Trial; NCT01895361). Ataga et al (2017) stated the 
up-regulation of P-selectin in endothelial cells and platelets 
contributes to the cell-cell interactions that are involved in the 
pathogenesis of vaso-occlusion and sickle cell-related pain 
crises. The safety and efficacy of crizanlizumab, an antibody against the adhesion molecule P-selectin, were evaluated in 
patients with sickle cell disease. In this double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial, patients were 
assigned to receive low-dose crizanlizumab (2.5 mg per 
kilogram of body weight), high-dose crizanlizumab (5.0 mg per 
kilogram), or placebo, administered intravenously 14 times 
over a period of 52 weeks. Patients who were receiving  
concomitant hydroxyurea as well as those not receiving 
hydroxyurea were included in the study. The primary end point 
was the annual rate of sickle cell-related pain crises with high- 
dose crizanlizumab versus placebo. The annual rate of days 
hospitalized, the times to first and second crises, annual rates  of uncomplicated crises (defined as crises other than the acute 
chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, splenic sequestration, 
or priapism) and the acute chest syndrome, and patient- 
reported outcomes were also assessed. A total of 198 patients 
underwent randomization at 60 sites. The  median rate of crises per year was 1.63 with  high-dose crizanlizumab versus 
2.98 with placebo (indicating  a 45.3% lower rate with high- 
dose crizanlizumab, P=0.01). The median time  to the first crisis was significantly longer  with high-dose crizanlizumab 
than with placebo (4.07 vs. 1.38 months, P=0.001), as was the 
median time to the second crisis (10.32 vs. 5.09 months, P=0.02). The median rate of uncomplicated crises per year   
was 1.08 with high-dose crizanlizumab, as compared with 2.91 
with placebo (indicating a 62.9% lower rate with high-dose 
crizanlizumab, P=0.02). Adverse events that occurred in 10%  
or more of the patients in either active-treatment group and at   
a frequency that was at least twice as high as that in the 
placebo group were arthralgia, diarrhea, pruritus, vomiting,

1/22/2021 and chest pain. The authors concluded that in patients with 
sickle cell disease, crizanlizumab therapy resulted in a 
significantly lower rate of sickle cell-related pain crises than placebo and was associated with a low incidence of adverse 
events.
