Introduction  
A pulmonary nodule is a growth i n the lung. Finding out if a nodule is benign (not harmful) or 
malignant (cancerous) often involves taking a sample of the nodule. Getting this sample requires 
an invasive procedure (invasive means something is put into the body). Depending on where the 
nodule is, the sample can be collected by passing a needle through the skin and chest wall  into 
the lung or using a viewing instrument called a bronchoscope that’s passed down the throat and 
into the lung’s airways. When there is a strong suspicion of cancer, surgery can also be used to remove the nodule, and  a sample is then examined to determine if cancer is present. Recently, 
tests have been developed that look at certain levels of proteins in the blood. The goal is to try to determine if invasive testing is needed for pulmonary nodules. These protein test s are 
investigational (unproven). More study is needed to determine if these tests are effective.

Evidence Review   Page | 3 of 9  ∞  
Description 
Plasma -based proteomic screening is a  molecular test available in the diagnostic workup of 
pulmonary nodules. To rule out malignancy, invasive diagnostic procedures such as computed 
tomography (CT) -guided biopsies, bronchoscopies, or video -assisted thoracoscopic procedures 
are often required,  but each carry procedure- related complications ranging from postprocedure 
pain to pneumothorax. Molecular diagnostic tests have been proposed to aid in risk -stratifying 
patients to eliminate or necessitate the need for subsequent invasive diagnostic procedures.  
 
Background  
Pulmonary Nodules  
Pulmonary nodules are a common clinical problem that may be found incidentally on a chest x -
ray or computed tomography (CT) scan or during lung cancer screening studies of smokers. The 
primary question after the detection of a pulmonary nodule is the probability of malignancy, 
with subsequent management of the nodule based on various factors such as the radiographic 
characteristics of the nodules (e.g., size, shape, density) and patient factors ( e.g., age, smoking 
history, previous cancer history, family history, environmental/occupational exposures). The key 
challenge in the diagnostic workup for pulmonary nodules is appropriately ruling in patients for 
invasive diagnostic procedures and ruling out patients who should forgo invasive diagnostic 
procedures. However, due to the low positive predictive value of pulmonary nodules detected 
radiographically, many unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures and/or surgeries are 
performed to confirm or eliminate the diagnosis of lung cancer.  
 
Proteomics  
Proteomics is the study of the structure and function of proteins. The study of the concentration, 
structure, and other characteristics of proteins in various bodily tissues, fluids, and other 
materials has been proposed as a method  to identify and manage various diseases, including 
cancer. In proteomics, multiple test methods are used to study proteins. Immunoassays use antibodies to detect the concentration and/or structure of proteins. Mass spectrometry is an 
analytic technique that ionizes proteins into smaller fragments and determines mass and 
composition to identify and characterize them. Page | 4 of 9  ∞  
Plasma-Based Proteomic Screening for Pulmonary Nodules Plasma -based proteomic screening has been investigated to risk- stratify pulmonary nodules as 
likely benign to increase the number of patients who undergo serial CT scans of their nodules 
(active surveillance), instead of invasive procedures such as CT -guided biopsy or surgery. 
Additionally, proteomic testing may also determine a likely malignancy in clinically low -risk or 
intermediate- risk pulmonary nodules, thereby permitting earlier detection in a subset of 
patients. 
Xpresys® Lung and BDX -XL2 (Nodify ® XL2) are plasma -based proteomic screening test s that 
measure the relative abundance of proteins from multiple disease pathways associated with 
lung cancer using an analytic technique called multiple reaction monitoring mass spectroscopy. 
The role of the test s is to aid physicians in differentiating likely benign from likely malignant 
nodules. If the test yields a likely benign result, patients may choose active surveillance via serial CT scans to monitor the pulmonary nodule. If the test yields a likely malignant result, invasive 
diagnostic procedures would be indicated. The test is therefore only used in the management of pulmonary nodules to rule in or out invasive diagnostic procedures and does not diagnose lung 
cancer.  
REVEAL Lung Nodule Characterization is a plasma- protein biomarker test that may ai d clinicians 
in characterizing indeterminate pulmonary nodules (4- 30 mm) in current smokers 25 years of 
age and older. The test is based on a multianalyte assay with a proprietary algorithmic analysis 
using immunoassay, microarray, and magnetic nanoparticle detection techniques to obtain 
laboratory data for calculation of the risk score for lung cancer. The REVEAL Lung Nodule 
Characterization is presented on a scale from 0 to 100 with a single cut point at 50. The score is based on the measurement of 3 clin ical factors  (age, sex, and nodule diameter) and 3 proteins 
(epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], prosurfactant protein B [ProSB], and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 [TIMP1]  associated with the presence of lung cancer. It may aid a clinician 
in the decision to perform a biopsy or to consider routine monitoring. It is not intended as a 
screening or stand- alone diagnostic assay.  
 
Summary of Evidence  
For individuals with undiagnosed pulmonary nodules detected by computed tomography (CT) who receive plasma -based proteomic screening, the evidence includes prospective cohorts and 
prospective- retrospective studies. Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease- specific 
survival, test accuracy and validity, morbid events, hospitalizations, and resource utilization. Page | 5 of 9  ∞ Clinical validation studies were identified for two  versions of a proteomic classifier.  This classifier 
has undergone substantial evolution, from a 13- protein assay to a 2-protein assay integrated 
with clinical factors. Because of this evolution, the most relevant studies are with the most recent 
version two. One validation study on the version two has been identified. The classifier has been 
designed to have high specificity for malignant pulmonary nodules, and the validation study 
showed a  specificity of 97% for patients with low to moderate pretest probability (< 50%) of a 
malignant pulmonary nodule. The primary limitation of this study is that a high number of 
patients were excluded from the study due to incomplete clinical data or because they were subsequently determined to be outside of the intended use population. It is unclear if the 
intended use population was determined a priori. Validation in an independent sample in the 
intended use population is needed. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the 
technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
A clinical validation retrospective study for risk assessment for indeterminate pulmonary nodules 
using a plasma -protein based biomarker assay was identified  as having a 94% specificity for 
correctly identifying intermediate risk samples as either low risk or high risk. Limitations of this 
study include the need to assess the test in other races (the majority tested were white), assess 
how other conditions might affect the performance of the assay such as obesity and its pro -
inflammatory state, or steroid use, and assess how compliance with follow -up may affect 
whether a diagnosis might be missed. A clinical utility study is also needed to assess the impact 
of the algori thm on clinical decision making along with long -term follow -up with the rate of 
lung cancer deaths prevented to verify the test is an effective marker of aggressive lung cancer. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the 
net health outcome.

Practice Guidelines and Position Statements  
Guidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion if they were issued by, or 
jointly by, a US professional society, an international society with US representation, or National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines that are 
informed by a systematic review, include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.  
 
American College of Chest Physicians  
In 2013, the American College of Chest Physicians published evidence- based clinical practice 
guidelines on the diagnosis and management of lung cancer, including pulmonary nodules, which is discussed in the patient population parameters in the Plasma -Based Proteomic 
Screening of Pulmonary Nodules section.
15 
 
American Thoracic Society  
In 2017, the American Thoracic Society published a position statement on the evaluation of molecula r biomarkers for the early detection of lung cancer.
16 The Society states that "a clinically 
useful molecular biomarker applied to the evaluation of lung nodules may lead to expedited 
therapy for early lung cancer and/or fewer aggressive interventions in patients with benign lung 
nodules." To be considered clinically useful, a molecular diagnosis "must lead to earlier 
diagnosis of malignant nodules without substantially increasing the number of procedures 
performed on patients with benign nodules" or "fewer procedures for patients with benign 
nodules without substantially delaying the diagnosis of cancer in patients with malignant nodules." Page | 7 of 9  ∞  
Medicare National Coverage  
MolDX will provide limited coverage for the BDX -XL2 test (Biodesix) for the management of a 
lung nodule between 8 and 30mm in diameter, in patients at least 40 years of age and with a 
pre-test cancer risk of 50% or less, as assessed by the Mayo Clinic Model for Solitary Pulmonary 
Nodules. 
 
Regulatory Status  
Clinical laboratories m ay develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory 
service; laboratory- developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Xpresys® Lung 2/Nodify XL2 (BDX -XL2; 
(Integrated Diagnostics [Indi], purchased by Biodesix ), and Reveal Lung Nodule Characterization 
(MagArray , Inc.)  are available under the auspices of the CLIA . Laboratories that offer laboratory -
developed tests must  be licensed by the CLIA  for high- complexit y testing. To date, the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of these test.
