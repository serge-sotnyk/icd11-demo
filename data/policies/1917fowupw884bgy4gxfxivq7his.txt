Introduction  
Nerves send messages to the brain, including pain signals. When there’s an injury or other 
problem, a message of pain travels along the nerve, to the spinal cord, and then into the brain. 
One way to try to treat chronic pain is to destroy—ablate —a small portion of the nerve that’s 
sending the pain signal. This technique has been well studied and is proven in very limited situations. However, destroying part of a nerve to try to treat chronic headaches or facial pa in is 
investigational (unproven). While some small, early studies have shown promise, more, larger, and longer high-quality studies are needed to determine whether nerve ablation is truly 
effective for chronic headaches and facial pain.

Evidence Review   
 
Description 
Several procedures or treatments have been proposed for the treatment of chronic headaches 
(chronic migraines, chronic tension- type headaches, chronic cluster headaches, and cervicogenic 
headaches),  occipital neuralgia , and persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP)  when conventional 
treatments such as oral and injectable pharmacological treatments, physical therapy, 
chiropractic care, or transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS)  have failed. These proce dures 
include chemical neurolysis, cryoablation, pulsed radiofrequency, and radiofrequency ablation. The proposed effect of these procedures is to inhibit the transmission of pain signals that are 
sent to the brain from the sensory nerves such as the occipital nerve (greater or lesser), upper 
cervical nerves , supraorbital  and supratrochlear nerves (branches of the frontal and trigeminal 
nerves) , or sphenopalatine ganglion nerve.  
 
Background  
Headaches  
The International Headache Society ( IHS) created a headache classification system (the 
International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition) which is considered the standard 
for diagnosis of all types of headaches.  The third edition was published in January of 2018, thirty 
years after its first publication in 1988. The three classifications are: primary headaches, 
secondary headaches and painful cranial neuropathies, and other facial pains and other 
headaches. See the description for these chronic headache types along with diagnostic criteria 
below in Practice Guidelines and Position Statements.   
 
Page | 4 of 17  ∞ 
  
Chronic Migraine  
Chronic migraine is believed to affect 2 percent of the world population. It is defined by having 
15 or more headache days a month lasting at least 4 hours per day for more than 3 months. 
Chronic migraines occur more often in women and may be accompanied by sensitivity to light or sound along with nausea and/or vomiting.  
 
Chronic Tension-Type Headache  
Chronic tension-type headaches are episodic occurring on 15 or more days a month for over 3 
months, lasting hours or days, and may be unremitting. They usually occur on both sides of the 
head and are described as a pressing or tightening feeling around the head.  Chronic Cluster Headac he 
Chronic cluster headaches are rare and classified as one of the trigeminal autonomic 
cephala lgias (TACs). They usually occur on one side of the head  around one eye or temple, have 
a sudden onset , and are generally severe and intense, lasting for minutes  or several hours at a 
time, over a year or longer without remission. These headaches occur more frequently in men. 
The cause is unknown. Common descriptors used to describe the headaches are “excruciating,” “feeling like an ice pick is being driven through my eye,” or “explosive.” Common symptoms that 
accompany the headaches: coming on just as a person goes to sleep, tearing in the affected eye, 
drooping eyelid of the affected eye, and experiencing nasal stuffiness or a runny nose.  
 
Cervicogenic Headache  
Cervicogenic headache is considered a secondary headache where headache pain is referred 
from bony structures or soft tissues of the neck. Involvement of the C2- 3 zygapophyseal joint is 
the most frequent source of cervicogenic headache in  up to 70 percent of cases. Cervical range 
of motion may be reduced and the headache may be made worse with certain movements of 
the neck or when pressure is applied to certain spots in the neck. The diagnosis may be  
 
Page | 5 of 17  ∞ 
 confirmed with two anesthetic blocks of the suspected pain generator, performed at dif ferent 
times, and associated with pain relief that is in keeping with the anesthetic used.  
 
Occipital Neuralgia  
Occipital neuralgia is a rare type of headache described as short bursts of stabbing, throbbing, 
or shooting pain in the upper neck which spreads to the back of the head and is transmitted by 
the occipital nerves, usually to only one side of the head. It commonly develops spontaneously, 
with a sudden onset, and may  also be accompanied by decreased or abnormal sensation in the 
affected  area. There are generally no neurologic deficits found on exam, but there may be 
tenderness over the affected nerve branches when palpated. The exact pathophysiology is unknown. One theory is that it may arise from injury to the C2- C3 nerve roots and/or occipital 
nerves via entrapment, trauma (such as whiplash), or inflammation.  
Diagnosis is generally confirmed when pain relief is obtained by a local anesthetic block to the occipital nerves.  
 
Persistent Idiopathic Facial Pain (PIFP)  
Persistent idiopathic facial pain ( PFIP) , previously known as atypical facial pain , is characterized 
by persistent facial and/or oral pain recurring daily for 2 hours or more per day for greater than 
3 months. There is no associated clinical neurological deficit. Most cases are seen in women. The 
pain is commonly felt around the mouth or chin but is generally poorly localized and does not 
follow the distribution of a peripheral nerve. The pain is possibly thought to  be related to injury 
to the face, teeth, or gums. It  is described as dull, aching, or of a nagging quality. It is generally a 
diagnosis of exclusion.  
 
Ablative Treatments  
Chemical Neurolysis (Chemodenervation)  
Chemical neurolysis, also known as chemical ablation, chemodenervation, or chemical 
denervation, is the application of a chemical destructive agent (eg, phenol, ethyl alcohol,  
 
Page | 6 of 17  ∞ 
 glycerol , or hypertonic saline) to a nerve to create a long -lasting or permanent interruption of 
neural transmission. It is usually used to relieve pain.  
 Cooled Radiofrequency Ablation  
Cooled radiofrequency is a minimally invasive method in which a radiofrequency generator 
transmits a small current of thermal radiofrequency energy through an insulated, water- cooled, 
electrode or probe placed within tissue to target the sensory nerves responsible for sending pain signals. Coolief™ (Haylard Health) circulates water through the device while heating 
nervous tissue to create a larger treatment area than conventional radiofrequency is able to 
treat. “This combination of ionic heating, produced by the friction of charged water molecules, and cooling deactivates the nerves responsible for sending pain signals to the brain by targeting 
the pain-transmitting nerves without excessive heating, leading to pain relief.”
27 Coolief™ is 
performed in an outpatient setting. 
 Cryoneurolysis (Cryoablation) 
Cryoneurolysis, also known as cryodenervation, cryo ablation , cryotherapy, or cryoanalgesia, 
temporarily blocks nerve conduction along peripheral pathways using a small probe to freeze 
the target nerve and treat a variety of painful conditions. Cryoneurolysis treatments that use 
nitrous oxide (boiling point of - 88.5 ⁰ C) as the coolant are reversible. Nerves treated in this 
temperature range experience a disruption of the axon, with Wallerian degeneration occurring distal to the site of injury. The axon and myelin sheath are affected, but the connective tissues 
remain intact. The axon can regenerate along the nerve path, usu ally at the rate of 1 -2 mm per 
day. Thus, the nerve basically dies as it freezes, which stops the pain signals from transmitting. However, over time the nerve regrows, which may mean recurrence of the pain. Cryoneurolysis differs  from c ryoablation in that cryoablation treatments use liquid nitrogen (boiling point of  
-195.8⁰ C) as the coolant. Treatments of the nerve in this temperature range are irrever sible as 
the nerves experience a disruption of both the axon and the endoneurium connective tissue 
layer.

 Pulsed Radiofrequency  
Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) is a non- or minimally neurodestructive technique, where short 
bursts of radiofrequency energy are  applied to nervous tissue to treat various chronic pain 
syndromes. It is seen as an alternative to continuous (non- pulsed) radiofrequency ablation, as it 
is theorized to have significantly less complications or side effects. Its exact mechanism of action 
is unclear.  
Pulsed radiofrequency is delivered in short bursts , twice per seco nd, followed by a quiet phase in 
which no current is applied. This allows for cooling of the electrode keeping it below the 
neurodestructive threshold of 45⁰ C. Pulsing the radiofrequency current allows the power output 
of the generator to be greatly increased , allowing for far stronger electrical fields than in 
continuous radiofrequency. For example, the voltage output is usually 15- 25 volts for the 
continuous mode radiofrequency. The pulsed radiofrequency output  is 45 volts. As a result, 
higher voltages can be applied in pulsed radiofrequency. Because the average temperature near 
the pulsed radiofrequency electrode does not reach the neurodestructive range, the risk of 
destroying nearby tissue is reduced.  
 
Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)  
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive method that involves the use of heat and 
coagulation necrosis to destroy nerve tissue. A needle electrode is inserted through the skin and 
into the tissue around the nerve to be ablated. A high- frequency electrical current is applied to 
the target tissue which heats the nerve, causing coagulation necrosis and destruction of the 
nerve. It is theorized that the thermal lesioning of the nerve destroys peripheral sensory nerve 
endings, resulting in the alleviation of pain.  
 
Summary of Evidence  
For individuals who have various types of headaches (chronic migraines, chronic tension- type 
headaches, chronic cluster headaches, and cervicogenic headaches as well as occipital neuralgia 
and persistent idiopathic facial pain) who received ablative treatments such as chemical 
neurolysis, cryoablation, pulsed radiofrequency, and RFA, the evidence includes randomized 
controlled trials, prospective studies, retrospective studies, and case reports. Some studies  
 
Page | 8 of 17  ∞ 
 yielded promising results showing improvement in pain and decrease in pain medication usage . 
However, despite these encouraging clinical studies, conclusive evidence demonstrated in well -
designed clinical studies in support of chemical neurolysis, cryoablation, pulsed  radiofrequency, 
or radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of headaches and atypical facial pain is warranted.  
While these treatment modalities appear to be safe, the evidence of efficacy is limited. Further 
placebo -controlled trials are needed. The overall quality of evidence is low. All studies were 
limited by methodological flaws, such as small sample size, lack of a control group, and short 
follow -up. Before definitive conclusions can be drawn, there is a need for high- quality studies 
with larger populations, adequate follow -up time, standardized treatment protocols, and 
comparisons of the treatment being studied with other treatments used for the same diagnosis which have also failed conventional treatments. The evidence is insufficient to determine the 
effects of this technology on net health outcomes.

American Society of Anesthesiologists and American Society of Regional 
Anesthesia and Pain Medicine  
In 2010, the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Chronic Pain Management and 
the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine issued practice guidelines for 
Chroni c Pain Management which included the following: 
Ablative techniques include chemical denervation, cryoneurolysis or cryoablation, thermal 
intradiscal procedures (ie, intervertebral disc annuloplasty [ IDET], transdiscal biaculoplasty) , and 
radiofrequency ablation.  
• Chemical denervation: (eg, alcohol , phenol, or high-concentration local anesthetics) should 
not be used for routine care of patients with chronic noncancer pain 
• Cryoneurolysis or cryoablation: may be used in the care of selected patients (eg, 
postthoracotomy pain syndrome, low back pain [medial branch] , and peripheral nerve pain)  
• Radiofrequency ablation: conventional radiofrequency ablation may be performed for neck 
pain, and water- cooled radiofrequency ablation may be used for chronic sacroiliac joint pain. 
Conventional or thermal radiofrequency ablation of the dorsal root ganglion should not be routinely used for the treatment of lumbar radicular pain

 Medicare National Coverage  
There is no national coverage determination.  
 
Regulatory Status  
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a procedure and, therefore, is not subject to regulation by the 
FDA. However, the devices used to perform RFA are regulated by the FDA premarket approval process. There are numerous devices listed in the FDA 510(k) premarket approval process. Two 
product codes are dedicated to these devices, one for radiofrequency lesion generators (GXD) and one for radiofrequency lesion probes (GXI) (FDA, 2016)  
In 2017 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared for marketing  (K163461)  COOLIEF 
(Halyard Health, Inc.)  radiofrequency lesion probe. It is to be used in conjunction with a 
radiofrequency generator to create lesions in nervous tissue. Cooled radiofrequency (Cooled RF) 
is also indicated for creating radiofrequency lesions of the genicular nerves for the management 
of moderate to severe knee pain of more than 6 months in patients with radiologically confirmed osteoarthritis and a positive response to a diagnostic genicular nerve block .
