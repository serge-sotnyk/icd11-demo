Introduction  
BCR-ABL is a n abnormal  gene that is  found in a specific chromosome in people who have 
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The BCR -ABL gene makes a protein known as a tyrosine 
kinase. Tyrosine kinase acts as an “on/off switch” in a cell and  causes certain types of cancer cells 
to grow uncontrollably, leading to specific types of blood cancer (leukemia). Newer types of 
chemotherapy attack cellular targets specifically involved in tumor growth. Drugs that target the 
BCR-ABL protein are known as BCR -ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This policy describes when 
BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors may be considered medically necessary.

Evidence Review   
 
Description 
Cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of malignant cells. Nearly 1.4 
million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer this year, and approximately 570,000 will die of 
the disease. The good news is, survival rates for cancer are on the rise, increasing from 50% to 
64% over the last 30 years.  
Conventional cytotoxic cancer chemotherapy has been one of the major medical advances 
realized in the last few decades. Although directed toward certain biologic targets thought to be 
involved in cellular growth and proliferation, typically they have not discriminated well between 
rapidly dividing normal cells ( e.g., bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract) and tumor cells, 
frequently resulting in toxicities. In addition, tumor responses to traditional cytotoxic cancer chemotherapies can be unpredictable and brief.  
“Targeted chemotherapies” ( e.g., monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antisense 
inhibitors of growth factor receptors) are the newest therapeutic approach. These agents have 
been designed to interfere with molecular targets that have a role in tumor growth and 
progression ( e.g., tyrosine kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor, epithelial growth factor, 
farnesyl transferase inhibition). There are typically more of these targets on or in tumor cells, 
thus these therapies are more attracted to tumor cells than to normal cells. The promise of these Page | 7 of 18  ∞ agents is that they will provide a broader therapeutic index with less toxicity. They may also be 
useful in combination with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies, immunotherapies or radiation 
to produce additive or synergistic activity without overlap in toxicity profiles.  
The Philadelphia Chromosome mutation was first described in 1960 as a translocation of parts of 
chromosomes 9 and 22. The result is that part of the BCR ("breakpoint cluster region") gene 
from chromosome 22 (region q11) is fused with part of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 (region q34). A BL stands for "Abelson", the name of a leukemia virus which carries a similar protein. The 
result of the translocation is a protein of p210 or sometimes p185 (p simply stands for "protein"; the numbers represent the apparent molecular weight of the mutant proteins in kDa  
[kilodaltons] ). The fused " BCR-ABL " gene is located on the resulting, shorter chromosome 22. 
Because ABL carries a domain that can add phosphate groups to tyrosine residues (tyrosine 
kinase) the BCR-ABL fusion gene is also a tyrosine kinase. The BCR region is also a 
serine/threonine kinase. 
The fused BCR-ABL protein interacts with the interleukin-3 receptor beta(c) subunit. The BCR -
ABL transcript is constitutively active. In turn, BCR -ABL activates a number of cell cycle-
controlling proteins and enzymes, speeding up cell division. Moreover, it inhibits DNA repair, 
causing genomic instability and potentially causing blast crisis in CML.  
The BCR-ABL kinase inhibiting agents currently available are as follows:

Gleevec® (imatinib) is a protein- tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the BCR -ABL tyrosine 
kinase, the abnormal tyrosine kinase created by the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality in Page | 8 of 18  ∞ chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This inhibition prevents proliferation and induces 
apoptosis of the abnormal cells. Gleevec® is also an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases 
for platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF) and stem cell factor (SCF), and c- kit. In vitro, Gleevec® 
inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) cells, which express an activating c- kit mutation.  
Sprycel® (dasatinib) and nilotinib are inhibitors of multiple protein- tyrosine kinases, including 
BCR-ABL, SRC family, c -KIT, EPHA2 and PDGFR -beta). Based on modeling studies, Sprycel is 
predicted to bind to multiple conformations of the ABL kinase.  
Scemblix®  (asciminib)  is an ABL/BCR -ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Asciminib inhibits the ABL1 
kinase activity of the BCR -ABL1 fusion protein, by binding to the ABL myristoyl pocket. In studies 
conducted in vitro or in animal  models of CML, asciminib showed activity against wild -type BCR -
ABL1 and several mutant forms of the kinase, including the T315I mutation. 
Gleevec® , approved in 2001, revolutionized treatment of CML. The imatinib molecule fits tightly 
into the ATP binding site of the BCR -ABL tyrosine kinase, interfering with function of the 
abnormal protein. Thus it is called a BCR -ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor or BCR -ABL TKI. Long 
term follow -up of some of the first imatinib individual s shows an 8- year event -free survival of 
81%. However, 17% of individuals do not respond to imatinib, and of those that do, 15% later 
lose their response. Primary resistance (failure to achieve remission in 3 -6 months) may be 
caused by excessive plasma protein binding, or reduced drug transport into the cell. Secondary resistance is thought to be most commonly due to acquired mutations in the drug binding site of the BCR -ABL TK protein. Mutations in imatinib- resistant individual s have been mapped and 
sequenced. Second and third generation TKI’s – dasatinib, nilotinib, later bosutanib, and most 
recently ponatinib - have been developed to overcome imatinib-resistant mutations. In vitro 
binding and growth inhibition studies for these drugs are ava ilable for an ever- increasing 
number of mutations. 
There is increasing evidence that mutations in the BCR -ABL gene correspond to success or 
failure of different TKI’s. However, this information has limits on clinical usefulness. Over 80% of 
individuals do well on first -line agents and do not harbor mutations. Of individuals that fail 
imatinib therapy, Parker et al. were able to detect mutations in 28% of individuals by sequencing, and 32% by mass spectrometry. Soverini et al. estimated that 29% of individuals 
with imatinib failur e harbor a detectible mutation in the BCR -ABL binding site. Branford et al. 
report a 10- 20% mutation detection rate by sequencing, and of those for whom a mutation was 
detected, 43% had a mutation that was useful to guide clinical decisions. Mutations are now 
detected in about half of imatinib resistant individuals, and of those mutations that are detected, 
20-25% are useful for guiding treatment choice. Differences in defining treatment failure, as well Page | 9 of 18  ∞ as increasing numbers of mutations in advancing disease, may account for variability in reported 
percentages.  
New methods of mutation detection are developing. Mass spectrometry can be used to identify mutations that are at too low a clonal level to be detected by sequencing. Denaturing high-performa nce liquid chromatography (D -HPLC) is also more sensitive but does not characterize 
the mutation, and may be used to screen samples before sequencing. A rapid PCR method is available to detect the T315I mutation, which is resistant to all TKI’s except ponatinib. Whether 
individuals could be screened for this single mutation to guide therapy has not been tested.  
Despite the wealth of information on mutations and in vitro sensitivity, there are no published 
prospective clinical trials on the clinical usefulness of mutational analysis to select a TKI. Studies 
to date are r etrospective or observational. For example, in the phase II efficacy trial of Nilotinib 
in imatinib -resistant individual s, mutation data were collected at baseline and thereafter. 
Individual s who had no mutation detected, or mutations with high in vitro sensitivity to nilotinib, 
had a better response than those with mutations that were resistant to nilotinib in vitro 
(mutations Y253H, E255K/V, F359C/F). Omacetaxine, a protein translation inhibitor, has been 
approved by the FDA as second- line therapy, and other potential treatments for imatinib-
resistant individuals are being tested. 
As individuals who are successful on primary therapy are maintained for longer periods with 
molecular markers below the level of detection, the question has arisen as to whether they may 
actually be able to discontinue TKI therapy. In one pilot study, 100 individuals who had been on imatinib for >2 years with complete molecular response discontinued treatment. At one year, 
41% remained in complete molecular response. All of the 69% that relapsed remained sensitive 
to imatinib.  
 
Rationale  
The effectiveness of Sprycel® (dasatinib) is based on hematologic and cytogenetic response 
rates. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit, such as improvement in 
disease- related symptoms or increased survival. To date, Sprycel® has been studied in four 
uncontrolled Phase II pivotal clinical trials and one Phase II pilot study in individuals in all phases 
of CML, as well as BRC -ABL+ (Ph+) ALL.  
Two Phase II studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of Sprycel® in individual s with chronic 
phase CML who were previously treated with Gleevec® (imatinib). One randomized, non-comparative pilot study enrolled individual s (N=150) after failure of low -dose Gleevec® ( i.e., 
<600 mg/day). One other single-arm study enrolled individuals (N=186) who were resistant to Page | 10 of 18  ∞ or intolerant of Gleevec® at any dose. The primary endpoint in both studies was the rate of 
major cytogenetic response (MCyR). In the pilot study, 35% of Sprycel® -treated individuals 
achieved a MCyR at 12 weeks and 21% achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR). In the single -arm study 39% of individuals achieved a MCyR.  
Three single- arm Phase II studies were performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
Sprycel® in individuals with advanced stage CML and BRC -ABL+ (Ph+) ALL who were resistant 
to or intolerant of Gleevec. The primary endpoint in these studies was the rate of major 
hematologic response (MaHR) and overall hematologic response (OHR). 
Spyrcel® was also evaluated in two pediatric studies which examined chronic phase CML in 97 
total individuals. The first trial (N=51) examined newly diagnosed chronic phase CML individuals, 
while the 2
nd trial (n=46) looked at individuals that were resistant or intolerant to imatinib. The 
studies both found increasing trends for CCyR, MCyR, and MMR across 3 to 24 months.  
The safety and efficacy of nilotinib has been studied in one uncontrolled, open- label, phase II 
pivotal clinical trial in imatinib -resistant and -intolerant individuals with all phases of CML, as 
well as Ph+ ALL.  Hematologic and cytogenetic response rates ranged from 16%- 74%. In a 
preliminary report from another single-arm, open- label, phase II study, nilotinib has also shown 
activity in individuals with all phases of Ph+ CML and Ph+ ALL who were unresponsive or 
intolerant to both imatinib and dasatinib. No controlled clinical trials for the agent are available 
at this time.  
Although no head -to-head clinical t rials between the second -generation TKIs nilotinib and 
dasatinib are available, their safety profiles appear to differ. Nilotinib notably carries a boxed warning for QT prolongation and sudden death and the need to take the drug on an empty 
stomach (avoid food two hours before and within one hour after dose). A greater incidence of grade 3/4 elevated serum lipase and electrolyte abnormalities were reported with nilotinib. 
While a greater incidence of grade 3/4 myelosuppression, bleeding- related events, and fluid 
retention were reported with dasatinib.  
Management guidelines developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend individuals with disease resistant to primary treatment with imatinib should be 
treated with bosutinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib in the second -line setting, taking into account 
BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutation. For individual with disease resistant to primary treatment 
with bosutinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib can be treated with an alternative TKI (other than imatinib)  in the second- line setting, taking into account BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutation status. 
 Page | 11 of 18  ∞ NCCN Compendium and Other Practice Guidelines  
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Drugs and Biologics Compendium is 
based directly on the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. The compendium lists specific panel recommendations for off -label uses of drugs, and each recommendation is 
supported  by a level of evidence category. 
The NCCN Categories of Evidence and Consensus used in the recommendations are:  
• Category 1: The recommendation is based on high level evidence ( e.g., randomized 
controlled trials) and there is uniform NCCN consensus.  
• Category  2A: The recommendation is based on lower -level evidence and there is uniform 
NCCN consensus.  
• Category 2B: The recommendation is based on lower -level evidence and there is nonuniform 
NCCN consensus (but no major disagreement).  
• Category 3: The recommendation is based on any level of evidence but reflects major disagreement. 
In June 2008, the NCCN Compendium became one of four references for Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services (CMS) for oncology coverage policy. In its national coverage decision 
CMS st ates that, in general, a use identified by the NCCN Compendium is medically accepted if 
the indication is a Category 1 or 2A as defined by NCCN. A use is not medically accepted if the 
indication is a Category 3 in NCCN. The local CMS contractor, Noridian Administrative Services 
(NAS), has issued an additional coverage statement regarding Category 2B:  
NAS recognizes NCCN Categories of Evidence Levels Category 1 and Category 2A ONLY as 
medically accepted indications. If a provider chooses to use NCCN level 2B in support of a 
chemotherapeutic drug used off -label in an anti -cancer chemotherapeutic regimen, NAS 
expects that the provider will make available to NAS significant peer-reviewed Phase II or Phase III studies demonstrating such support. In the absence of such studies, level 2B evidence does not support such use.  
 
2010 Update  - The NCCN Drug Compendium  
The Company recognizes indications and uses of drugs listed in the NCCN Drugs and Biologics 
Compendium with Categories of Evidence and consensus of 1 and 2A as proven and Categories 
of Evidence and Consensus of 2B and 3 as unproven. However, Category 2B uses may be Page | 12 of 18  ∞ considered for coverage if they are substantiated by provider submission of significant peer-
reviewed Phase II or Phase III studies demonstrating treatment effectiveness.  
This policy agrees with July 2010 NCCN Drugs and Biologics Compendium recommendations of 
1 and 2A. 
 
2011 Update  
A literature search was conducted from October 2010 to September 2011. No maj or new 
developments were found.  
Emerging evidence in CML individuals suggests that response rates can be increased by careful 
attention to therapeutic drug monitoring. Hehlmann and colleagues randomized 1014 newly-
diagnosed CML individuals to receive 400mg/day, 800mg/day tolerability adjusted or 
400mg/day plus alpha interferon. Individual s receiving the higher dose imatinib had a higher 
rate of MMR at 12 months than with imatinib 400 mg/d (59% [95% CI: 53% to 65%] v 44% [95% CI: 37% to 50%]; P < .001) or imatinib 400 mg/d plus IFN -α (59% v 46% [95% CI: 40% to 52%]; P 
= .002). Median dose in the 800-mg/d arm was 628 mg/d with a maximum dose of 737 mg/d during months 4 to 6 and a maintenance dose of 600 mg/d. All three treatment approa ches 
were well tolerated with similar grade 3 and 4 adverse events. The authors concluded that treatment of early- phase CML with imatinib can be optimized by giving early high- dose therapy 
followed by rapid adaptation to good tolerability. MMR at 12 months was strongly correlated 
with survival at 1 and 3 years.  
 
2012 Update  
A literature search was conducted from October 2011 to October 2012. No major new 
developments were found.  
The TOPS trial published this year further elucidated the relationship between Imatinib trough 
plasma levels and achievement of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular 
response (MMR). The clinical significance of this in terms of practice changes remains to be assessed.  
Ibrahim et al. demonstrated an incremental benefit from sequential administration of imatinib followed by one of the newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors after imatinib failure.  
 Page | 13 of 18  ∞ 2013 Update  
A complete review was prepared for the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee in January 2013. 
Focus was on the role of the newer agents in this class and the possibility of using genetic testing to predict resistance to imatinib or some of the other drugs in this class. Unfortunately, 
the technology was not sufficiently developed for use in routine clinical practice. 
The medical necessity criteria for imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib were updated to include 
currently labeled indications, and indications were added for bosutinib and ponatinib. These 
were also compared with current NCCN Compendium listings.  
The European Leukemia Net (ELN) guidelines recommend imatinib as first- line therapy, with 
nilotinib or dasatinib as second line. Bosutinib and ponatinib have now also been approved as second -line agents.  
 
2014 Update  
A literature search was conducted from January 2013 to June 2014. No major new developments were found.  
 
2015 Update  
A literature search was conducted from June 2014 to May 2015. No major new developments
