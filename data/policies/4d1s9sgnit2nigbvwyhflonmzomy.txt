Introduction  
BRAF and MEK are proteins involved in a key pathway that  sends signals inside cells which 
stimulate cell growth. It is  faulty (mutated) in some human cancers. The defective proteins signal 
constantly, stimulating overgrowth of the cells. BRAF and MEK inhibitors stop this signaling. This 
has been shown to slow the growth of melanomas that have spread through the body and can’t 
be removed by surgery. This policy describes when BRAF and MEK inhibitors may be considered 
medically necessary.  
 
Note:    The Introduction section is for your general knowledge and is not to be taken  as policy coverage criteria. The 
rest of the policy uses spe cific words and concepts familiar to medical professionals. It is intended for 
providers . A provider can be a person, such as a doctor, nurse, psychologist, or dentist. A provider also can 
be a place where medical care is given, like a hospital, clinic, or lab. This policy informs them about when a 
service may be covered.

Evidence Review   
 
Melanoma 
Melanoma accounts for only about 1% of skin cancers but, because it is more likely to 
metastasize than squamous cell or basal cell cancers, it causes a large  amount of skin cancer 
deaths. If recognized and treated early, it is almost always curable. Approximately 84% of 
melanomas are diagno sed at a localized stage with 5 -year survival of 98%. However, the 5- year 
survival for the 4% of individuals with metastatic disease at diagnosis is 15%.  
Incidence rates for melanoma have been rising for at least 30 years. The age- adjusted incidence 
rate of melanoma was 20.8 per 100,000 men and women per year for the years 2004 to 2008. 
The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 99, 780 new melanomas will be 
diagnosed (approximately 57, 180 in men and 42, 600 in women), and that approximately 7, 650 
people will die of melanoma  (approximately 5,0 80 men and 2,570 women)  in 2022 in the U.S.  
The lifetime risk of melanoma is about 2.6% for Caucasians, 0.6 % for Hispanics, and 0.1% for 
African Americans. Major risk factors for melanoma include atypical nevi (moles), more than 50 
benign or atypical nevi, giant congenital nevus, and a personal or family history of melanoma. 
Other risk factors for all skin cancer types include: sun sensitivity (defined as easily being sun 
burned), freckling, tanning with difficulty, or having naturally blond or red hair. Other risk factors 
include having a history of excessive sun exposure (including sunburns), use of tanning booths and immune-deficiency states ( e.g., immunosuppressive chemotherapy, post -transplant 
immunosup pression, HIV/AIDS). 
 
BRAFV600E Mutation and Response to Dabrafenib, Encorafenib and 
Vemurafenib (BRAF Inhibitors) and Binimetinib, Cobimetinib and 
Trametinib (MEK Inhibitors)  
BRAF (B member of the Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma family of serine/threonine tyrosine 
kinases) is a protein that in normal melanocytes is part of the mitogen- activated protein kinase Page | 6 of 13  ∞ (MAPK) – extracellular signal -regulated kinase (ERK) signal transduction pathway. This signaling 
pathway controls cell growth, survival, differentiation and senescence. More than 40 mutations 
of BRAF are known in human cancer, 90% to 95% of which are V600E, in which glutamic acid is 
substituted for valine at amino acid position 600. Mutated BRAF leads to constitutive activation 
of the MAPK -ERK signaling pathway, resulting in tumor maintenance and progression. BRAF 
mutation may be a negative prognostic indicator in metastatic melanoma.  
 
Summary of Evidence  
Encorafenib/Binimetinib  
Encorafenib in combination with binimetinib was evaluated in a randomized, active- controlled, 
open-label,  multicenter trial (COLUMBUS; NCT01909453). Eligible individuals were required to 
have BRAF V600E or V600K mutation -positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma . Individuals 
could have received immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. 
Prior use of BRAF  inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was prohibited. Individual s were randomized 
(1:1:1) to receive encorafenib 450 mg once daily in combination with binimetinib 45 mg twice 
daily (encorafenib in combination with binimetinib), encorafenib 300 mg once daily, or 
vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity.  
A total of 577 individuals were randomized, 192 to the encorafenib in combination with 
binimetinib arm, 194 to the encorafenib arm, and 191 to the vemurafenib arm. Of the 383 
individuals randomized to either the encorafenib in combination with binimetinib or the 
vemurafenib arms, the median age was 56 years (20 to  89 years), 59% were male, 91% were 
White, and 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0. Of these 95% had metastatic disease, 65% were Stage IVM1c, and 4% received prior immunotherapy. Twenty- eight percent 
(28%) had elevated baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 45% had ≥ 3 organs with 
tumor involvement at baseline, and 3% had brain metastases. Based on centralized testing, 
100% of individual s’ tumors tested positive for BRAF mutations; BRAF V600E (88%), BRAF V600K 
(11%) , or both (<1%). Encorafenib in combination with binimetinib demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in median PFS (14.9 months compared to 7.3 months with vemurafenib 
monotherapy. 
 Page | 7 of 13  ∞ Dabrafenib/Trametinib  
The safety and efficacy of dabrafenib co- administered with trametinib were evaluated in two 
international, randomized, active- controlled trials: one double- blind trial (the COMBI -d study; 
NCT01584648) and one open- label trial (the COMBI -v study; NCT01597908). The COMBI- d study 
compared dabrafenib and trametinib to dabrafenib and placebo as first -line therapy for 
individuals with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E or V600K 
mutation -positive cutaneous melanoma. Individuals were randomized (1:1) to receive dabrafenib 
150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily or dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily plus matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> the 
upper limit of normal (ULN) vs. ≤ ULN) and  BRAF mutation subtype (V600E vs. V600K). The 
major efficacy outcome was investigator- assessed progression- free survival (PFS) per RECIST 
v1.1 with additional efficacy outcome measures of overall survival (OS) and confirmed overall response rate (ORR).  
The COMBI -v study compared dabrafenib and trametinib to vemurafenib as first -line treatment 
therapy for individual s with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E or 
V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. Individuals were randomized (1:1) to receive 
dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily or vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Randomization was stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> the upper limit of 
normal (ULN) vs. ≤ ULN) and BRAF mutation subtype (V600E vs. V600K). The major efficacy 
outcome measure was overall survival. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS and ORR 
as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1.  
In the COMBI- d study, 423 individuals were randomized to dabrafenib plus trametinib (n = 211) 
or dabrafenib plus placebo (n = 212). The median age was 56 years (range: 22 to 89 years), 53% were male, > 99% were White, 72% had ECOG performance status of 0, 4% had Stage IIIC, 66% 
had M1c disease, 65% had a normal LDH, and 2 individual s had a h istory of brain metastases. All 
individuals had tumor containing BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as determined by centralized testing, 85% with BRAF V600E mutations and 15% with BRAF V600K mutations. 
In the COMBI- v study, 704 individuals were randomized to dabrafenib plus trametinib (n = 352) 
or single- agent vemurafenib (n = 352). The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 91 years), 
96% were White, and 55% were male, 6% percent of individuals had Stage IIIC, 61% had M1c 
disease, 67% had a normal LDH, 70% had ECOG performance status of 0, 89% had BRAF V600E 
mutation -positive melanoma, and one individual had a history of brain metastases.  
The COMBI -d and COMBI -v studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS: 
11.4 months with dabrafenib+trametinib (95% CI 9.9, 14.9) vs 7.3 months (5.8, 7.8) with vemurafenib. Page | 8 of 13  ∞ A phase 2/3 randomized, open-label, global, parallel assignment study was conducted to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib in individuals with 
BRAFV600 mutation positive low -grade glioma (LGG) or relapsed/refractory high-grade glioma 
(HGG). Individuals were randomized to receive either dabrafenib in combination with trametinib or carboplatin in combination with vincristine. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall 
response rate (ORR) in the first 32 weeks of treatment, and the individuals in the treatment 
group had a statistically significant overall response rate (ORR) of 47% compared to 11% for the 
chemotherapy group (p <0.001). The secondary efficacy endpoints were duration of response, progression- free survival, and overall survival. The result showed that the individuals in the 
treatment group had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 20.1 months, which was significantly longer than the 7.4 months observed in the chemotherapy group (p < 0.001). 
Furthermore , 89% of individuals in the treatment group experienced a reduction in tumor size 
compared to baseline, while only 70% of the individuals in the chemotherapy group had a reduction in the tumor size compared to the baseline.  
Pyrexia, vomiting, and headache were among the common adverse events observed in the 
treatment group. About 47% individuals in the treatment group had grade 3 or higher adverse 
events, which was significantly lower than the 94% observed in the chemotherapy group. The 
discontinuation rate due to adverse events was also lower in the treatment group, with only 4% 
individuals discontinuing the treatment, compared to 18% in the chemotherapy group. 
 
Vemurafenib/Cobimetinib  
The safety and efficacy of vemurafenib+cobimetinib was established in a multicenter, 
randomized (1:1), double- blinded, placebo -controlled trial conducted in 495 individuals with 
previously untreated, BRAF V600 mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic, melanoma. All individuals received vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily on days 1– 28 and were randomized 
to receive cobimetinib 60 mg or matching placebo orally once daily on days 1– 21 of an every 
28-day cycle. Randomization was stratified by geographic region (North America vs. Europe vs. 
Australia/New Zealand/others) and disease stage (unresectable Stage IIIc, M1a, or M1b vs. Stage 
M1c). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Individuals 
randomized to receive placebo were not offered cobimetinib at the time of disease progression. 
The major efficacy outcome was investigator- assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 
v1.1. The median age of the study population was 55 years (range 23 to 88 years), 58% of 
individuals were male, 93% were White and 5% had no race reported, 60% had stage M1c 
disease, 72% had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0, 45% had an elevated baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 10% had received prior adjuvant therapy, and <1% had previously Page | 9 of 13  ∞ treated brain metastases. Individual s with available tumor samples were retrospectively tested 
using next generation sequencing to further classify mutations as V600E or V600K; test results 
were obtained on 81% of randomized individuals. Of these, 86% were identified as having a 
V600E mutation and 14% as having a V600K mutation. Median PFS was 12.3 months ( 95% CI 9.5, 
13.4) vs. 7.2 months with vemurafenib monotherapy (5.6,7.5) . 
 
Practice Guidelines and Position Statements  
National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN) 
NCCN guidelines recommend combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy for metastatic or 
unresectable melanoma  with a BRAF V600 activating mutation: 
• First-line therapy for BRAF/MEK inhibitors:  
o Dabrafenib/trametinib (category 1)  
o Vemurafenib/cobimetinib (category 1)  
o Encorafenib/binimetinib (category 1)  
• Other recommended first -line preferred regimens  
o Combination targeted therapy and immunotherapy with vemurafenib/cobimetinib + 
atezolizumab (category 2A)  
• Second -line or subsequent therapy  
o Dabrafenib/trametinib (category 2A)  
o Vemurafenib/cobimetinib (category 2A)  
o Encorafenib/binimetinib (category 2A)  
• Re-induction therapy for individuals who experience disease control (complete response, 
partial response, or stable disease) and have no residual toxicity, but subsequently experience disease progression/relapse >3 months after treatment discontinuation. 
• In previously untreated individuals with unresectable AJCC 7th Edition stage IIIC or stage IV 
disease, BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy was associated with improved response 
rate, PFS, and OS compared to BRAF inhibitor monotherapy  Page | 10 of 13  ∞ • If BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy is contraindicated, BRAF inhibitor monotherapy 
is an option, especially in individuals who are not appropriate candidates for checkpoint 
immunotherapy
