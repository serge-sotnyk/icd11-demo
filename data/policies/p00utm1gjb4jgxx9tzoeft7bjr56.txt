Introduction  
Lymphatic fluid is a clear fluid that travels throughout the body. Its job is to remove wastes and 
bacteria from tissue. Lymphedema is swelling when too much lymphatic fluid accumulates in any 
part of the body. Lymphedema can be a result of certain surgeries or other procedures that 
remove or affect lymph node drainage . Lymphedema occurs because there are fewer natural 
channels for the fluid to move through. Typical treatment calls for raising the affected limb , 
massaging the area, or using pumps that apply light pressure. Certain surgeries are now being 
studied. These surgeries call for rerouting the flow of lymphatic fluid by connecting lymph vessels to veins, lymph nodes and veins, or lymph vessels to  other lymph vessels. Other 
surgeries try to reduce swelling by moving other tissue into the surgical area or using sucti on to 
remove excess fat and proteins. Many  of these surgeries are investigational (unproven). More 
studies are needed to see how well they work over the long term.  
 
Note:    The Introduction section is for your general knowledge and is not to be taken  as policy coverage criteria. The 
rest of the policy uses specific words and concepts familiar to medical professionals. It is intended for 
providers . A provider can be a person, such as a doctor, nurse, psychologist, or dentist. A provider also can 
be a place where medical care is given, like a hospital, clinic, or lab.  This policy informs them about when a

Evidence Review   
 
Description 
Surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer can lead to lymphedema and are some  of the most 
common causes of secondary lymphedema. There is no cure for lymphedema. However, 
physiologic microsurgical techniques such as lymphaticovenular anastomosis or vascul arized 
lymph node transfer have been developed that may improve lymphatic circulation, thereby 
decreasing symptoms and risk of infection.  
Lymphedema is an accumulation of fluid due to disruption of lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema 
can be caused by congenital or inherited abnormalities in the lymphatic system (primary 
lymphedema) but is most often caused by acquired damage to the lymphatic system (secondary 
lymphedema). 
Lipedema is a disorder characterized by a large amount of subcutaneous fat in the extremit ies, 
typically the legs and thighs. The adipose tissue may be painful. In contrast, lymphedema is the 
accumulation of interstitial fluid due to impaired lymphatic flow. This increase in interstitial fluid 
may lead to the accumulation and hypertrophy of fat  cells. Liposuction, consisting of the 
removal of fat cells with a cannula and tumescent anesthesia, is being investigated as a treatment option for both lipedema and lymphedema. Page | 6 of 24  ∞ Background  
Lymphedema  
Lymphedema is an abnormal accumulation of interstitial  fluid and fibroadipose tissue in 
subcutaneous tissues or body cavities. In the extremities, capillaries in the superficial lymphatic 
system drain the lymph in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, which then flows into the deep 
system and then the lymph nodes, finally draining into the venous circulation. Accumulation of 
interstitial lymph fluid occurs when the accumulation of lymph exceeds the capacity of the system to drain. The excessive fluid may cause the accumulation and hypertrophy of fat cells. 
Primary lymphedema may occur due to congenital anomalies or an inherited condition. 
Secondary lymphedema has a variety of causes that reduce lymph drainage including surgical removal of lymph nodes, post- radiation fibrosis, scarring of lymphatic channels, obesity, and 
chronic lymphatic overload. Cancer- associated lymphedema can occur due to obstruction, 
infiltration, removal of lymph nodes, irradiation, or medications. Nearly all cases of lymphedema 
in the U.S. are secondary to cancer or cancer treatment.  
The most  common cancer- associated lymphedema occurs in women who have undergone 
axillary surgery and/or axillary radiation therapy for breast cancer. The risk of developing arm lymphedema is associated with the extent of axillary lymph node dissection, and there i s a 
greater risk of lymphedema in breast cancer patients who undergo dissection compared to 
those who undergo biopsy.  
 
Diagnosis and Staging  
A diagnosis of secondary lymphedema is based on history (e .g., cancer treatment, trauma) and 
physical examination (localized, progressive edema and asymmetric limb measurements) when 
other causes of edema can be excluded. Imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, 
computed tomography, ultrasound, or lymphoscintigraphy, may be used to differentiate lymphedema from other causes of edema in diagnostically challenging cases. 
Table 2  lists International Society of Lymphology guidance for staging lymphedema based on 
"softness" or "firmness" of the limb and the changes with an elevation of the limb.
1 Page | 7 of 24  ∞ Table 2 . Recommendations for Staging Lymphedema 
Stage  Description  
Stage 0 (subclinical)  Swelling is not evident and most patients are asymptomatic despite impaired lymphatic 
transport  
Stage I (mild)  Accumulation of fluid that subsides (usually within 24 hours) with limb elevation; soft edema 
that may pit, without evidence of dermal fibrosis  
Stage II (moderate)  Does not resolve with limb elevation alone; limb may no longer pit on examination  
Stage III (severe)  Lymphostatic elephantiasis; pitting can be absent; skin has trophic changes  
 
Breast Cancer −Related Lymphedema  
Breast cancer treatment is one of the most common causes of secondary lymphedema. Both the 
surgical removal of lymph nodes and radiotherapy are associated with development of 
lymphedema in individuals with breast cancer.  
In a systematic review of 72 studies (N=29,612 women), DiSipio et al (2013) reported that 
approximately 1 in 5 women who survive breast cancer will develop arm lymphedema.2 
Reviewers reported that risk factors for development of lymphedema that had a strong level of 
evidence were extensive surgery ( i.e., axillary -lymph-node dissection, greater number of lymph 
nodes dissected, mastectomy) and being overweight or obese. The incidence of breast cancer-
related lymphedema was found by DiSipio et al as well as other authors to be up to 30% at 3 
years after treatment.2,3,4 
Studies have also suggested that Black breast cancer survivors are nearly 2.2 times more likely to 
develop breast cancer- related lymphedema compared to White breast cancer survivors.5 These 
observations may be linked to racial disparities with regards to access to treatment and the types of treatments received. Black women are more likely than White women to undergo 
axillary lymph node dissection, which is associated with greater morbidity than the less invasive 
sentinel lymph node biopsy. While this may be explained in part by Black individuals having a 
higher likelihood of being diagnosed with more aggressive tumors, there is evidence that even 
when adjusting for stage and grade of tumors, Black women are more likely to undergo ax illary 
lymph node dissection, putting Black women at greater risk of breast cancer- related 
lymphedema. Additionally, Black breast cancer survivors, on average, have higher body mass 
indexes than White breast cancer survivors, which could contribute to development of 
lymphedema in this setting as well.  
 Page | 8 of 24  ∞ Management and Treatment  
Early and ongoing treatment of lymphedema is necessary. Conservative therapy may consist of 
several features depending on the severity of the lymphedema. Individual s are educated on t he 
importance of self -care including hygiene practices to prevent infection, maintaining ideal body 
weight through diet and exercise, and limb elevation. Compression therapy consists of repeatedly applying padding and bandages or compression garments. Manual lymphatic 
drainage is a light pressure massage , performed by trained physical therapists or by individuals, 
designed to move fluid from obstructed areas into functioning lymph vessels and lymph nodes. Complete decongestive therapy is a multiphase treatment program involving all of the previously mentioned conservative treatment components at different intensities. Pneumatic 
compression pumps may also be considered as an adjunct to conservative therapy or as an 
alternative to self -manual lymphatic drainage in individuals who have difficulty performing self -
manual lymphatic drainage. In individual s with more advanced lymphedema after fat deposition 
and tissue fibrosis has occurred, palliative surgery using reductive techniques such as liposuction 
may be performed.

 Page | 9 of 24  ∞ Axillary Reverse Mapping  
Axillary reverse mapping (ARM), involves subcutaneous administration of blue dye, fluorescence 
(i.e., indocyanine green), or radioisotopes to allow for visualization of the lymphatic drainage 
pathways of the arm and breast. This visualization is intended to distinguish and enable preservation of axillary lymph nodes and lymphatics in individuals undergoing sentinel lymph 
node biopsy and/or axillary lymph node dissection. It is believed that because the axilla and 
breast have mostly separate drainage pathways, the risk of lymphedema is reduced by avoiding 
the removal of lymph nodes and lymphatics that only drain the axilla identified through ARM. In 
the event that ARM reveals that the axillary nodes cannot be spared, for example due to crossover of sentinel and axillary nodes, lymphatic physiologic microsurgery has been explored 
as a method to preserve the axillary nodes, though evidence is limited  
 
Reductive (Excisional or Ablative ) Surgical Interventions 
Reductive techniques remove fibrous, fatty tissue that has developed from sustained lymphatic 
fluid stasis. Reductive interventions include direct excision and liposuction procedures.  
• Direct excision: There are several direct excision procedures for the treatment of extremity 
and genital lymphedema. Subcutaneous tissue is excised along with the skin and soft tissues 
to attempt to reduce the volume of the affected area. The resulting defects are then covered 
with tissue flaps or skin grafts. Wound healing complications and infections have been 
reported side effects of this type of intervention along with sexual dysfunction, decreased sensation and urethral injury when performed on the genitalia.
35 
• Liposuction: Fibrous, fatty issue is removed through multiple small incisions of the affected 
extremity via a cannula attached to a powered suction device. Compression garments are 
worn postoperatively and may be required  indefinitely to maintain the adipose tissue 
volume reduction obtained with this procedure. This technique is intended for individuals 
with end -stage lymphedema who have not responded to conservative treatments. Minor 
complications such as occasional paresthesias and wound healing are reported with this 
technique.35 
 
 Page | 10 of 24  ∞ Liposuction for the Treatment of Lipedema  
Lipedema is a  rare disorder in which  increased adipose ( fat) tissue builds up under the skin 
causing non -pitting , symmetric, bilateral  swelling  of the lower extremities; the upper extremities 
can also be affect ed. Hands and feet characteristically do not swell. It primarily affects women. 
The cause of lipedema is unknown and there is currently no curative treatment for this 
condition. Signs and symptoms typically present at puberty, pregnancy, or menopause. Because 
of this , it is theorized that  there is a hormonal influence on the disorder. Hereditary factors are 
also thought to play a role in its etiology. Lipedema is often painful  and may present with 
bruising a long with  sensitivity to touch. This condition  gradually worsens over time and may 
progress to  a lipo -lymphedema due to the lymphatic load exceeding the lymphatic transport 
capacity . Lipedema  is often misdiagnosed as obesity or lymphedema but does not generally 
respond to weight loss, exercise, or elevation of the limbs as do those disorders. Over time, the 
weight of the excessive fat build- up can impair the ability to walk  and lead to reduced mobility. 
 
Types of Lipedema  
Type 1: Pelvis, buttocks and hips (saddle bag phenomenon) Type 2: Buttocks to knees with formation of folds of fat around the inner side of the knee Type 3: Buttocks to ankles Type 4: Arms Type 5: Isolated lower leg  
 
Stages of Lipedema  
Stage 1: Even and smooth skin surface with enlarged subcutaneous fat tissue  
Stage 2: Uneven skin surface with nodular elevations and indentations of subcutaneous fat and 
lipomas  
Stage 3: Large deforming growths of nodular fat or hanging flaps of the thighs and around the 
knees  
Stage 4: Large overhangs of tissue, dysfunctional lymphatics with lipedema and lipolyphedema  Page | 11 of 24  ∞ Treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms. Conservative care with combined decongestive 
therapy (manual lymphatic drainage and compression garments) is the mainstay  treatment of 
choice. If there is an inadequate response to conservative or supportive measures, tumescent 
liposuction has been proposed as the next line of treatment. Tumescent liposuction is a 
technique whereby local anesthetic, such as diluted lidocaine and epinephrine, is injected into 
subcutaneous fat and a vibrating cannula  associated with power -assisted liposuction removes 
the fat. Waterjet assisted liposuction is another method of liposuction that may be used to treat 
lipedema. This method uses a pressurized stream of saline to dislodge the fat and more gently 
loosen and remove the fat cells. 
 
Summary of Evidence  
For individuals who have breast cancer−related secondary lymphedema who receive physiologic 
microsurgery to treat lymphedema along with continued conservative therapy, the evidence 
includes a  randomized controlled trial  (RCT), observational studies, and systematic reviews. 
Relevant outcomes are symptoms, morbid events, functional outcomes, health status measures, 
quality of life, resource utilization, and treatment -related morbidity. Several physiologic 
microsurgeries have been developed; examples include lymphaticovenular anastomosis and vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) . No RCTs of lymphaticovenular anastomosis or similar 
surgeries involving the venous system were identified. One RCT of VLNT  with 36 participants has 
been conducted. Systematic reviews have indicated that the preponderance of the available 
evidence comes from single- arm clinical series from individual institutions. Surgical technique, 
outcomes metrics, and follow -up time have varied across these studies. These types of studies 
might be used for preliminary estimates of the amount of volume reduction expected from surgery, the durability of the reduction in volume, and the rates of adverse events. However, 
these studies are not adequate for determining the comparative efficacy of physiologic 
microsurgery vs conservative treatment or decongestive therapy, or the comparative efficacy of 
different microsurgery techniques. RCTs are needed. The evidence is insufficient to determine 
that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
For individuals who are undergoing lymphadenectomy for breast cancer who receive 
physiologic microsurgery to prevent lymphedema, the evidence includes an RCT, observational 
studies, and systematic reviews. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, 
morbid events, quality of life, and treatment -related morbidity. Lymphatic Microsurgical 
Preventing Healing Appro ach (LYMPHA) is a preventive lymphaticovenular anastomosis 
performed during nodal dissection. One RCT including 46 individuals has been conducted. The 
trial reported that lymphedema developed in 4% of women in the LYMPHA  group and 30% in Page | 12 of 24  ∞ the control group by 18 months of follow -up. However, because the cumulative incidence of 
lymphedema after breast cancer treatment approximates 30% at 3 years, longer follow -up is 
needed to assess the durability of the procedure. The trial methods of randomization and 
allocation concealment were not described and there was no blinding, potentially introducing 
bias. The remaining evidence consists of uncontrolled studies and systematic reviews of these studies. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement 
in the net health outcome . 
For individuals with lipedema who receive liposuction, the evidence includes case series with 
over 100 patients. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, functional outcomes, and quality of  life. Baseline to post -treatment comparisons provide low quality 
evidence that liposuction reduces limb circumference and may reduce pain and improve mobility in patients with advanced lipedema who have failed conservative therapy. The 
durability of the procedure is uncertain, and no studies were identified that compared 
liposuction to continued decongestive therapy. One such trial is currently in progress and will 
provide needed information on the benefits and harms of this procedure. The evidence is 
insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals with lymphedema who receive liposuction, the evidence includes a few small, 
controlled trials and an uncontrolled observational study with 5 yea r follow -up. Relevant 
outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, functional outcomes, and quality of life. The 
available studies suggest that arm volume can be reduced by the procedure, but follow- up is 
limited, and the trials have a number of other limitations that include lack of blinding, subjective outcome measures, lack of a physiotherapy control, and small sample size. The most rigorous 
evidence to date is a consecutive series of over 100 patients with detailed methodology. This 
series indicates that patients who have failed conservative therapy can have complete reversal of 
excess volume in the short term and that gains can persist through 5 years of follow -up when 
compression therapy is continued after surgery. However, no studies were identifi ed that 
compared liposuction to a decongestive therapy protocol with continued compression. Further 
study is needed to evaluate the impact of liposuction when compared to a decongestive therapy 
protocol. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an 
improvement in the net health outcome 
Randomized controlled trials are needed to prove the benefits of pedicled or laparoscopic free 
omental lymphatic flap for the management of lymphedema.  Page | 13 of 24  ∞ Reverse mapping using blue dye as a method  for preserving the lymphatic drainage of the arm 
in breast cancer cases or indo -cyanine green as a technique to identify lymph node drainage 
patterns to localize lymph nodes in the surgical treatment of lymphedema  are being 
investigated . Further studies are needed to determine the long -term outcomes of these 
techniques. The evidence is insufficient to determine that  the technology results in an  
improvement in the net  health outcome. 
Despite the lack of strong evidence, clinical guidelines recommend liposuction in individuals 
with advanced lipedema  and for chronic lymphedema as there is limited treatment available 
when conservative measures have failed.

National Lymphedema Network  
The National Lymphedema Network published a position paper on the diagnosis and treatment of lym phedema in 2011.
30 The paper provided  the following statements, although notably, the 
document has been retracted and the Network is currently in the process of drafting a new 
position statement:  Page | 15 of 24  ∞ “Microsurgical and supramicrosurgical (much smaller vessels)  techniques have been developed 
to move lymph vessels to congested areas to try to improve lymphatic drainage. Surgeries 
involve connecting lymph vessels and veins, lymph nodes and veins, or lymph vessels to lymph 
vessels. Reductions in limb volume have been reported and a number of preliminary studies 
have been done, but there are no long -term studies of the effectiveness of these techniques.”  
An update of this position paper is in development as of July 2022.  
 
International Society of Lymphology  
The Inte rnational Society of Lymphology published a n updated  consensus document on the 
diagnosis and treatment of peripheral lymphedema in 2020.31 The document stated the 
following on lymphaticovenous (or lymphovenous) anastomoses (LVA):  
LVA are currently in use at multiple centers around the world. These procedures have 
undergone confirmation of long -term patency (in some cases more than 25 years) and some 
demonstration of improved lymphatic transport (by objective physiologic measurements of long-term effica cy). Multiple lymphatic-venous anastomoses in a single surgical site, with 
both the superficial and deep lymphatics, allow the creation of a positive pressure gradient 
(lymphatic- venous) and evade the phenomenon of gravitational reflux without interrupting  
the distal peripheral superficial lymphatic pathways. Some centers particularly in areas of endemic filariasis also practice lymph nodal -venous shunts as a derivative method. Multiple 
centers are using LVA (LYMPHA) as a preventative measure in high risk patients.  
In 2020, the International Society of Lymphology published a consensus document on the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral lymphedema.
31 The consensus of the panel was that 
liposuction has been show n to completely reduce non-pitting lymphedema due to excess fat 
deposition, but long- term management requires strict patient adherence to compression 
garments.  
 
American Society of Breast Surgeons  
The American Society of Breast Surgeons published recommendations from an expert panel on 
preventive and therapeutic options for breast cancer- related lymphedema in 2017.32 The 
document stated that "the Panel agrees that LVA and VLNT may be effective for early secondary breast cancer-related lymphedema. ” Page | 16 of 24  ∞  
National Comprehensive Cancer Network  
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) published recommendations on 
management of lymphedema as part of its guideline on survivorship; however, it does not 
discuss physiologic microsurgical techniques.33 The guideline states that high- level evidence in 
support of  treatments for lymphedema are lacking. In addition, the NCCN guideline on breast 
cancer does not give recommendations on use of physiological microsurgical techniques for 
preventing or treating lymphedema.33 
 
American Association of Plastic Surgeons  
The American Association of Plastic Surgeons sponsored a conference to create consensus statements and recommendations for surgical treatment and prevention of upper and lower 
extremity lymphedema.
12 The recommendations were based on the results of a systematic 
review and meta -analysis. The relevant recommendations include:  
"There is evidence to support that lymphovenous anastomosis can be effective in reducing severity of lymphedema (grade 1C). There is evidence to support that vascular lymph node 
transplantati on can be effective in reducing severity of lymphedema (grade 1B). Currently, there 
is no consensus on which procedure (lymphovenous bypass versus vascular lymph node transplantation) is more effective (grade 2C). A few studies show that prophylactic lymphovenous bypass in patients undergoing extremity lymphadenectomy may reduce the 
incidence of lymphedema (grade 1B). More studies with longer follow -up are required to 
confirm this benefit."  
A 2021 consensus document sponsored by the American Association of Plastic Surgeons evaluated the evidence on surgical treatment of lymphedema.
74 The conference recommended, 
based on grade 1C (very low quality) evidence, that there is a role for debulking procedures such as liposuction and for liposuction combined with physiologic procedures in reducing the 
nonfluid component in lymphedema. 
 Page | 17 of 24  ∞ International Consensus Conference on Lipedema  
A 2017 international consensus conference on lipedema identified studies from Germany that 
reported long -term benefits for up to 8 years following liposuction, concluding that lymph-
sparing liposuction is the only effective treatment for lipedema.67

International Society for Dermatologic Surgery  
Austrian Academy of Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetic Medicine and the International Society for 
Dermatologic Surgery: Prevention of Progression of Lipedema with Liposuction Using Tumescent Local Anesthesia: Results of an International Consensus Conference . 2020.
70 This consensus 
statement concludes: “Lymph- sparing liposuction using tumescent local anesthesia is currently 
the only effective treatment for lipedema.”  
 
Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH)  
In 2019 CADTH published A Review of Clinical Effectiven ess and Guidelines for Liposuction for 
the Treatment of Lipedema .68 The guideline recommends that tumescent liposuction be 
considered the treatment of choice for individual s with an inadequate response to conservative 
measures.  
 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  
NICE issued clinical guidance (IPG723)  addressing the use of liposuction for chronic 
lymphedema in 2022.72 The guidance reviewed the evidence and concluded that current 
evidence on the safety and efficacy of liposuction for chronic lymphedema is adequate to 
support the use of this procedure provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical 
governance, consent, and audit. The evidence on safety shows that the potential risks include 
venous thromboembolism, fat embolism, and fluid overload. Individual selection should only be 
done by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in managing lymphedema. The procedure 
should only be done in specialist centers by clinicians with training and expertise in liposuction for lym phedema following agreed perioperative protocols.
