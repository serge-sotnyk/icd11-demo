INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE  
The following Coverage Policy applies to health benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of 
business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make coverage determinations. References to standard benefit plan 
language and coverage determinations do not apply to those clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting 
certain standard benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer’s particular benefit plan document 
[Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan docum ent] may 
differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a customer’s benefit plan 
document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer’s benefit 
plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage 
mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific 
instance require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any applicable 
laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. 
Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment 
and should never be used as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medi cal 
necessity and other coverage de terminations.

Coverage Policy Number : IP0075  When coverage is available and medically necessary, the dosage, frequency, duration of therapy, and site of 
care should be reasonable, clinically appropriate, and supported by evidence- based literature and adjusted 
based upon severity, alternative available treatments, and previous response to therapy.  
 
Continuation of Therapy  
 
Continuation of Armodafinil (Nuvig il) and modafinil (Provigil) is  considered medically necessary for continued use 
when initial criteria are met AND there is  docum entation of beneficial response.  
 
Authorization Duration  
 
Initial approval  duration is up to 12 months . 
Reauthorization approval duration is up to 12 months.  
 
Conditions Not Covered  
 Armodafinil (Nuvigil) and modafinil (Provigil) are considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY  
other use including the following (this list may not be all inclusive):
  
 
1. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  The American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice 
guidelines for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents (2011 and 2019) do not address the use of 
modafinil/ armodafinil.  11,12 These guidelines note that with the greater availability of approved medications for 
children/adolescents with ADHD, it has become increasingly unlikely that clinicians need to consider the off -
label  use of other medications.  Many options exist for the treatment of ADHD in adults (e.g., 
methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine) and further large scale trials that demonstrate benefit for modafinil in 
adults with ADHD are needed.  
 
2. Bipolar Disorder, including Bipolar Depression.  Limited data (one small study [n = 85] and case reports 
[n = 2]) are available that describe the use of modafinil for bipolar disorder and bipolar depression13-15  In one 
study (n = 257) armodafinil was not more effective than placebo i n treating bipolar depression .16  Only limited 
data support modafinil for this condition and more data are needed.  
 
3. Cancer -Related Fatigue.  The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines on cancer -related 
fatigue ( version 2.2022 – February 9, 202) no longer consider modafinil or armodafinil to be effective for the 
treatment of cancer -related fatigue and recommend against its use.  17 
 
4. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  Limited data characterize modafinil therapy in those with chronic fatigue 
syndrome.18  In a r andomized, double- blind, crossover study in 14 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, 
use of modafinil for 20 days had minimal effects on cognitive function and no significant effects on fatigue, 
health- related quality of life, or mood.19 More data are required to assess efficacy in this patient population.  
 
5. Excessive Daytime Sleepiness Associated with Primary Insomnia.  One randomized, placebo- controlled 
study found that neither combination therapy with modafinil and cognitive behavioral therapy nor modafi nil as 
monotherapy significantly decreased daytime sleepiness associated with primary insomnia. 20 
 
6. Enhancement of Performance in Situations of Induced Sleep Deprivation.  Studies are needed to define 
the role/ appropriateness of modafinil in these situations for the general population (as opposed to military 
personnel, etc.).  Studies have shown that modafinil may enhance performance and sustain alertness in 
individuals subjected to situations that deprive sleep (e.g., military aviation, emergency physicians). 21-24 
Further  studies are needed before its use in the general population in these types of situations can be 
promoted.  
 
7. Fibromyalgia.   Limited data are available regarding the use of modafinil in fibromyalgia with most of the data 
being observ ational.  25-27 Larger -sized, randomized, placebo- controlled trials are required to better assess  
 
Page 7 of 10  
Coverage Policy Number : IP0075  and validate the efficacy of modafinil in patients with fibromyalgia before it can be recommended as a 
therapeutic modality.  
 8. Hypersomnia, Fatigue or Sleepines s Due to Other Conditions ( not Idiopathic Hypersomnia ).  More 
data are needed in specific conditions to define the role of modafinil and armodafinil.  
 9. Post -Stroke Sleep -Wake Disorders or Sleep Disorders.   Sleep- wake disorders occur in approximately 
20% to 40% of patients that have experienced a stroke, which includes hypersomnia and excessive daytime 
sleepiness. Very limited data (i.e., case reports and one small study) have explored the use of modafinil in 
these patients to improve alertness .
28,29 More data are needed to determine effectiveness in this condition.  
 
Background  
 
OVERVIEW  
Armodafinil and modafinil, agents with wake -promoting actions that are similar to sympathomimetic agents (e.g., 
amphetamine and methylphenidate), are indicated to improve wakefulness in adults with excessive 
sleepiness associated with the following conditi ons:1,2 
• Narcolepsy . 
• Obstructive sleep apnea/hypoapnea syndrome  (approved as adjunctive therapy).  
• Shift work sleep disorder . 
 
Armodafinil and modafinil are Schedule IV controlled substances.1,2  Review of the medical literature notes many 
other uses of modafinil that are considered off -label or investigational.  While armodafinil has not been studied 
off-label to the same extent as modafinil, it is expected that armodafinil will have similar clinical efficacy for these 
uses.  Additionally, in the pivotal tri als for shift work sleep disorder, enrolled patients were required to work a 
minimum of five night shifts per month.  
 Two specialized tests, which can be performed in a sleep disorders clinic, are required to establish a diagnosis of narcolepsy.
3  Polysomn ogram (PSG) is an overnight recording of brain and muscle activity, breathing, and eye 
movements.  The multiple sleep latency test assesses daytime sleepiness by measuring how quickly a person 
falls asleep and whether they enter rapid eye movement (REM) sl eep.  On the day after PSG, the patient is 
asked to take five short naps separated by two hours over the course of a day.  If an individual falls asleep in < 8 
minutes on average over the five naps, this indicates excessive daytime sleepiness.  However, patients with 
narcolepsy also have an abnormally quick start to REM sleep.  If REM sleep happens within 15 minutes at least 
two times out of the five naps and the sleep study the night before, this is likely an abnormality caused by 
narcolepsy.  
 Guidelines  
Pertinent medical guidelines related to modafinil and armodafinil are summarized below.  
 
Narcolepsy and Cataplexy  
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) practice parameters for the treatment of central disorders of 
hypersomnolence were updated in 2021.
4,5 
• Modafinil, Wakix® (pitolisant tablets), Xyrem® (sodium oxybate oral solution), and Sunosi™ (solriamfetol 
tablets) are recommended as effective treatments for daytime sleepiness due to narcolepsy and reducing 
disease severity in adults  (Strong Recommendation for each) . 
• Wakix and Xyrem have also demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy 
(Strong Recommendation for each) . 
• Xyrem and armodafinil have Conditional Recommendations for the treatment of narcolepsy, showing efficacy 
for daytime sleepiness due to narcolepsy and reducing disease severity.  
• Dextroamphetamine has a Conditional Recommendation for the treatment of narcolepsy, showing efficacy 
for excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy.  
• Methyl phenidate has a Conditional Recommendation for the treatment of narcolepsy, showing efficacy in 
reducing disease severity.   
 
Page 8 of 10  
Coverage Policy Number : IP0075  • There was insufficient and inconclusive evidence to make recommendations for l -carnitine, scheduled naps, 
selegiline, triazolam, sele ctive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors (SNRIs).  
• Modafinil and Xyrem have Conditional Recommendations for the treatment of narcolepsy in pediatric 
patients.  
• A Strong Recommendation should be followed by  clinicians under most circumstances.  A Conditional 
Recommendation requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience and strongly consider the 
individual patient’s values and preferences to determine the best course of action.  
 
Excessive D aytime Sleepiness Associated with Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Hypoapnea Syndrome  
• According to the AASM guideline on medical therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [2006], continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most uniformly effective therapy, and, to date, this is the only 
intervention for OSA shown to have favorable impacts on both cardiovascular and neurobehavioral 
morbidities.6 
• Modafinil, in patients compliant with nasal CPAP, consistently improved subjective and objective sleepiness, 
quality of life, and vigilance compared with placebo.  
 Adjunctive/Augmentation Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder  
• According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA) practice guideline for the treatment of patients with 
major depressive disorder (2010), m odafinil (or methylphenidate) are potential treatments for sedation 
associated with antidepressant medications.7 
• The APA guidelines state that modafinil has shown benefit when combined with an SSRI, related to specific 
effects on residual symptoms such as fatigue and hypersomnolence.  
• The guidelines note that there is no clear guidance regarding the length of time modafinil should be co-
administered.  
• While armodafinil has not been studied for this use, it is considered to be interchangeable with modafinil for 
this condition.  
 Excessive Daytime Sleepiness Associated with Myotonic Dystrophy  
• Practice parameters from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), last updated in 2021, suggest 
that clinicians use modafinil for the treatment of hypersomnia secondar y to myotonic dystrophy in adults 
(Conditional).4,5 
• While armodafinil has not been studied for this use, it is considered to be interchangeable with modafinil for 
this condition.  
 Excessive Daytime Sleepiness Associated with Parkinson’s Disease  
• Practice parameters from the AASM (2021) suggest that clinicians use modafinil for the treatment of 
hypersomnia secondary to Parkinson’s disease in adults (Conditional).
4,5 
• While armodafinil has not been studied for this use, it is considered to be interchangeable with modafinil for 
this condition.  
 
Fatigue Associated with Multiple Sclerosis  
• Practice parameters from the AASM (2021) suggest that clinicians use modafinil for the treatment of 
hypersomnia secondary to multiple sclerosis in adults (Conditional).4,5 
• While  armodafinil has not been studied for this use, expert opinion considers it to be interchangeable with 
modafinil for this condition.  
 
Idiopathic Hypersomnia  
Idiopathic hypersomnia, a condition similar to narcolepsy, is characterized by constant or recurrent daytime 
sleepiness with no other cause of sleepiness, prolonged nocturnal sleep, difficulty awakening with sleep 
drunkenness, and long unrefreshing naps with no history of cataplexy.8-10 
• The AASM practice parameters for the treatment of central disorders  of hypersomnolence (2021) include 
recommendations for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia.4,5 
• Only modafinil has a Strong recommendation for use.   
 
Page 9 of 10  
Coverage Policy Number : IP0075  • Clarithromycin, methylphenidate, Wakix, and Xyrem have Conditional recommendations for the 
treatment of i diopathic hypersomnia in adults.
