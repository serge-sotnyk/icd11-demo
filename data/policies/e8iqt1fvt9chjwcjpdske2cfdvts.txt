III.	  Aetna  considers  tests  for  germline  point  mutations  in  the  RET  gene 
experimental  and  investigational  for  all  other  indications  (e.g.,  non- 
small cell lung cancer;  not an all -inclusive list)  because its 
eﬀectiveness  for  indications  other  than t he ones  listed  above  has  
not been  established.  
See CPB 0140 -Genetic Testing (../100_199/0140.html) for policy on 
genetic testing for non- member relatives of Aetna members. 
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) is a rare heritable disorder that 
affects the endocrine system and consists of the development of tumors 
(neoplasia) in at least two endocrine glands, though tumors can also 
develop elsewhere. These tumors can be noncancerous (benign) or 
cancerous (malignant). There are three major types of MEN: type 1 (MEN1), type 2 (MEN2) and type 4 (MEN4). 
MEN1 is characterized by tumors of the parathyroid glands, anterior 
pituitary and pancreatic islet cells and is caused by mutations in the 
MEN1 gene. 
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) is a cancer of the thyroid gland that 
st
arts in cells that release calcitonin. MTC is a common characteristic 
among individuals with MEN2. Some individuals with MEN2 also have 
pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal gland which causes high 
blood pressure. MEN2 is divided into three subtypes: type 2A (MEN2A), 
type 2B (MEN2B) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). 
MEN2 is caused by mutations in the RET gene. 
MEN4 appears to have similar signs and symptoms to MEN1; however, it 
is c
aused by mutations in the CDKN1B gene. 
Genetic testing for RET germline mutation has shown 100 % sensitivity 
and s
pecificity for identifying those at risk for developing inherited 
medullary thyroid cancer (multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, MEN 
2B, or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC)). Use of the genetic

assay allows earlier and more definitive identification and clinical 
management of those with a familial risk for medullary thyroid cancer 
when compared to the existing standard of annual biochemical monitoring. 
Medullary thyroid carcinoma is surgically curable if detected before it has 
spread to regional lymph nodes. However, lymph node involvement at 
diagnosis may be found in up to 75 % of patients for whom a thyroid 
nodule is the first sign of disease. Thus, there is an emphasis on early 
detection and intervention in families, which are affected by the familial 
cancer syndromes of MEN types 2A and 2B and FMTC, which account 
for 25 % of medullary thyroid cancer. 
After genetic counseling, most family members who test positive undergo 
surgery to remove the thyroid gland. First -degree relatives of those with 
MTC that appears to be sporadic in origin also undergo the biochemical 
test to verify that the patient's tumor is not caused by an inheritable form 
of this disease. 
Fialkowski et  al (
 2008)  stated that  multiple endocrine neoplasia type2A  
(MEN 2A) is  a genetic  syndrome  manifesting  as MTC, hyper - 
parathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma.  Multiple  endocrine  neoplasia 2A 
results  from  mutations  in  the  RET  proto -oncogene.  Hirschsprung  Disease  
(HD)  is a congenital condition characterized by  a  blockage  of the l  arge 
intestine due to poor muscle movement in the bowel. HD is a rare 
manifestation of MEN 2A and has been described in known MEN 2A families. These investigators described 2 MEN 2A families that were only 
identified after the diagnosis of HD. Kindred 1: A boy presented in infancy 
with HD. Genetic screening revealed a C609Y mutation, which is 
consistent with MEN 2A. Evaluation of his sister, father, and grandmother 
revealed the same mutation. All 3 had thyroidectomies demonstrating C-
cell hyperplasia. The grandmother had a microscopic focus of MTC. Kindred 2: An infant boy and his sister were diagnosed with HD as 
neonates. Genetic testing demonstrated a C620R gene mutation 
consistent with MEN 2A. Total thyroidectomies revealed metastatic MTC 
in the father and C- cell hyperplasia in both children. The authors 
concluded that HD can be the initial presentation of MEN 2A. They 
strongly recommend that genetic screening be performed in patients       
          
      
          
 
             
           
             
  
            
   
    
 
          
            
    
 
  
   
   
        
 
    
   
  
           
   
   
              
    
  
 
         
   
           
   
         
   
              RET Proto -Oncogene Testing -Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna Page 4 of 16 
presenting with HD, looking for the known RET mutations associated with 
MEN 2A. If a mutation consistent with MEN 2A is detected, genetic 
screening of all first-degree relatives in the kindred is recommended. 
In a case report, Pandey et al (2011) emphasized that all patients with a 
history of HD should consider screening for RET mutations (it should be 
noted that RET mutations are the predominant but only one of a number 
of possible causes of HD), as there is a well- established association 
between HD and MEN 2A. If present, this could facilitate early diagnosis 
of MEN 2A with resultant thyroidectomy prior to the onset of MTC or at 
least prior to the development of metastaticdisease. 
Vaclavikova et al (2012) noted that inactivating germline mutations in the 
RET proto -oncogene are the major genetic cause of HD. In some cases, 
HD can be associated with MTC that is commonly caused by activating 
RET mutations. These investigators performed retrospective and 
prospective genetic analyses of 157 patients with HD operated on 
between December 1979 and June 2011; DNA was isolated from 
peripheral leukocytes. Patients with HD as well as family members were 
tested for RET mutati ons by direct sequencing and single -strand 
conformation polymorphism methods. RET mutations were detected in 16 
patients (10 %). Association with MTC was found in 2 families, other 8 
families had a mutation with potentially high -risk of MTC development 
and 4 novel mutations were detected. Total colonic aganglionosis was 
noted to have a high mutation detection rate (40 %). Three patients 
underwent total thyroidectomy (2 had clinical manifestation of MTC, 1 C-
cell hyperplasia). The authors concluded that these findings showed the 
benefit of systematic RET mutation screening in HD patients in order to 
identify the ris k of MTC in the preclinical stage of the disease. All patients 
should be tested for RET mutations at least in exon 10, and now additionally in exon 11 and 13, as well. 
An UpToDate review on "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple 
endocrine neoplasia type 2" (Lips, 2013) states that "Hirschsprung 
disease (HD) is characterized by the absence of autonomic ganglion cells 
within the distal colonic parasympathetic plexus resulting in chronic obstruction and megacolon. In humans, inactivating mutations of the RET 
proto- oncogene have been associated with HD. HD is a heterogenic 
disorder, occurring both in a familial and in a sporadic form.

percent of familial and 15 to 35 percent of sporadic HD patients, 
mutations in the RET gene are involved. Most HD cases arise from loss 
of function mutations, RET haploinsufficiency, RET polymorphisms or haplotypes of the RET promotor region. Hirschsprung disease (HD) was 
found in 50 percent of children in a family with a C620 mutation .....RET 
proto- oncogene testing in infants presenting with Hirschsprung disease is 
useful and may identify new multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A kindreds". 
An UpToDate review on "Medullary thyroid cancer: Clinical 
manifestations, diagnosis, and staging" (Tuttle, 2014) states that "In a patient with negative RET proto- oncogene testing and no family history of 
MEN2 syndrome, biochemical testing for coexisting tumors is typically not 
required". 
In summary, RET proto -oncogene tests can be used to identify familial 
disease- causing RET point mutations in members of families known to be 
affected by inherited MTC. For members of families with defined RET point mutations, results of the RET proto -oncogene tests may be used to 
decide upon prophylactic thyroidectomy or continued monitoring is necessary. RET proto- oncogene tests may also be used to distinguish 
sporadic tumors from familial cancers in patients with MTC but without a 
previous family history of this disease, and in their first-degree relatives if 
the patient is found to have a germline RET mutation. Furthermore, RET 
proto- oncogene tests are also of clinical value for individuals with 
Hirschsprung disease. 
Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer 
Yoshida et al (2013) noted that recent discovery of ROS1 gene fusion in a 
subset of lung cancers has raised clinical interest, because ROS1 fusion-
positive cancers are reportedly sensitive to kinase inhibitors. To better 
understand these tumors, these researchers examined 799 surgically 
resected non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) by reverse transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and identified 15 tumors harboring 
ROS1 fusion transcripts (2.5 % of adenocarcinomas). The most frequent 
fusion partner was CD74 followed by EZR. The affected patients were often younger non- smoking female individuals, and they had overall 
survival (OS) rates similar to those of the ROS1 fusion -negative cancer 
patients. All the ROS1 fusion -positive tumors were adenocarcinomas

except 1, which was an adenosquamous carcinoma. Histologic 
examination identified an at least focal presence of either solid growth 
with signet- ring cells or cribriform architecture with abundant extracellular 
mucus in 53 % of the cases. These 2 patterns were reportedly also characteristic of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -rearranged lung 
cancers, and these data suggested a phenotypic resemblance between 
the ROS1- rearranged and ALK -rearranged tumors. All tumors except 1 
were immune -reactive to thyroid  transcription factor -1. Fluorescence  in- 
situ hybridization (FISH)  using ROS1 break-apart probes revealed 
positive re-arrangement  signals in 23 % to 93 % of  the tumor  cells in 
ROS1 fusion -positive cancers,  which were readily distinguished using  a 
15 % cutoff value from 50 ROS1 fusion -negative tumors tested,  which 
showed 0 %  to 6 % re- arrangement signals. However,  this  perfect test 
performance was  achieved  only when isolated 3' signals were included  
along with classic split signals  in the definition  of re-arrangement  
positivity. Fluorescence in- situ hybridization signal patterns  were 
unrelated to 5' fusion partner genes.  All ROS1 fusion -positive tumors  
lacked alteration of epidermal growth factor  receptor  (EGFR),  KRAS,  
HER2, ALK, and RET  genes. 
 
Lira et al  (2014) stated that approximately 7 %  of NSCLCs  harbor  
oncogenic fusions involving ALK,  ROS1, and  RET.  Although tumors  
harboring ALK fusions are highly  sensitive to crizotinib, emerging pre-  
clinical and clinical data demonstrated that  patients with ROS1 or RET  
fusions  may also benefit from  inhibitors targeting these kinases. Using a  
transcript- based  method,  these  investigators  designed  a  combination  of  3' 
over-expression and fusion -specific  detection strategies  to detect ALK,  
ROS1 and RET fusion transcripts in NSCLC tumors. They  validated the 
assay in 295  NSCLC  specimens and  showed that the assay is highly  
sensitive  and  specific.  ALK  results  were  100  %  concordant  with  FISH  (n  =  
52)  and  97.8  %  concordant  with  IHC  (n  =  179)  [sensitivity,  96.8  %  (95  % 
confidence  interval  [CI]:  91.0  %  to  98.9  %);  specificity,  98.8  %  (95  %  CI:  
93.6  %  to  99.8  %)].  For  ROS1  and  RET,  these  researchers  also  observed 
100  % concordance with FISH  (n = 46 and n =  15, respectively). They  
identified 7 ROS1 and 14 RET f  usion -positive tumors and confirmed  the  
fusion status by  RT-PCR and FISH.  One RET fusion involved a novel  
partner,  cutlike homeobox  1 gene (CUX1),  yielding an in- frame CUX1 - 
RET  fusion.  ROS1  and  RET  fusions  were  significantly  enriched  in  tumors  
without  KRAS/EGFR/ALK alterations.  ALK/ROS1/RET/EGFR/KRAS

alterations were mutually exclusive. The authors concluded that as a 
single -tube assay, this test showed promise as a more practical and cost-
effective screening modality for detecting rare but targetable fusions in NSCLC. 
Wijesinghe et  al  (2015)
  noted that ROS1  and RET gene fusions were 
recently  discovered  in  NSCLC  as  potential  therapeutic  targets  with  small-  
molecule  kinase  inhibitors.  The  conventional  screening  methods  of  these 
fusions are time -consuming and require samples  of  high quality and 
quantity. These researchers  described a novel and efficient  method by  
coupling the power  of  multiplexing PCR and  the sensitivity  of mass  
spectrometry.  The multiplex mass spectrometry platform simultaneously  
tests  samples  for  the  expression  of  9  ROS1  and  6  RET  fusion  genes.  The 
assay  incorporated  detection  of  wild- type  exon  junctions  immediately  up- 
stream  and down -stream  of the fusion junction to exclude  false -negative 
results.  To flag  false -positives,  the  system  also  comprised  2  independent  
assays  for each fusion  gene junction. The  characteristic  mass  
spectrometric  peaks  of  the  gene  fusions  were  obtained  using  engineered 
plasmid constructs. Specific assays  targeting  the wild -type gene exon 
junctions were validated using complimentary DNA  from  lung  tissue of  
healthy  individuals.  The system was  further validated using  
complimentary  DNA  derived from  NSCLC  cell lines that express  
endogenous  fusion  genes.  The  expressed  ROS1 -SLC34A2  and  CCDC6 - 
RET gene fusions from the NSCLC  cell lines  HCC78 and LC -2/ad, 
respectively,  were  accurately detected by the novel  assay.  The assay is  
extremely sensitive, capable of detecting an event  in test specimens  
containing 0.5 %  positive tumors. Th e authors  concluded that the novel 
multiplexed assay is robustly  capable of  detecting 15 different  clinically  
relevant RET and ROS1 fusion  variants.  
Ross
i et al (2017) stated that immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a widely -
tested, low-cost and rapid ancillar y technique available in all laboratories 
of pathology. This method is generally used for diagnostic purposes, but 
several studies have investigated the sensitivity and specificity of different 
immunohistochemical antibodies as a surrogate test in the determination 
of predictive biomarkers in NSCLC, particularly for epidermal EGFR gene 
mutations, ALK gene and ROS1 re-arrangements. In this review, a critical 
examination of the works comparing the consistency of IHC expression and conventional molecular techniques to identify genetic alterations with

predictive value in NSCLC was discussed. Summarizing, data on 
sensitivity and specificity of antibodies against ALK and ROS1 are very 
consistent and time has comes to trust in IHC at least as a cost-effective 
screening tool to identify patients with re- arranged tumors in clinical 
practice. On the other hand, mutant -specific antibodies against EGFR 
demonstrated a good specificity but a low-to-fair sensitivity, then raising 
some cautions on their employment as robust predictive biomarkers. A 
brief comment on preliminary experiences with antibodies against BRAF, 
RET, HER2 and c -MET was also included. 
Furthermore,NationalComprehensive Cancer Network’s clinical practice 
guideline on "Non- small cell lung cancer" (Version 4.2016) states that 
"Emerging biomarkers include HER@ …. ROS1 and RET gene 
rearrangement". 
Pheochromocytoma / Paraganglioma 
Pheochromocytoma is a rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor that 
develops in cells in the center of an adrenal gland, leading to attacks of 
raised blood pressure, palpitations and headache. Paraganglioma is a tumor of the tissue composing the paraganglion, a small round body 
containing chromaffin cells, found near the aorta and in the kidney, liver 
heart and gonads. 
Brito and associates (2015) noted that the presence of germline 
mutat
ions in sporadic pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (SPPs) 
may change the clinical management of both index patients and their family members. However, the frequency of germline mutations in SPPs 
is unknown. In a systematic review, these researchers described the frequency of germline mutations in SPPs and determined the value of testing index patients and their family members for these mutations . They 
searched databases through June 2012 for observational studies of patients with SPPs who underwent germline genetic testing. The criteria 
used  to  define  sporadic  tumors  were 
(i) the absence of a family history 
of  PCC/PG  (ii)  the  absence  of  syndromic  features  (iii)  the  absence  of  
bilateral disease,  and (iv) the absence of metastatic disease.        
        
    
         
         
   
    
     
             
     
   
    
  
    
           
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
     
 
 
     
      
  
 
 
         
 
  
  
 These investigators included 31 studies including 5,031 patients (mean 
age of 44 years). These patients received tests for any of these 10 
mutations: SDHAF2, RET, SDHD, SDHB, SDHC, VHL, TMEM127, MAX, 
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and NF1. The overall frequency 
of germline mutation in SPP was 551 of 5,031 (11 %); when studies with 
patients fulfilling 4 criteria for sporadic tumors were used, the frequency 
was 171 of 1,332 (13 %). The most common germline mutation was 
SDHB 167 of 3,611 (4.6 %). Little outcome data were available to assess 
the benefits of genetic testing in index cases and family members. The 
authors concluded that the frequency of germline mutations in SPPs is 
approximately 11 to 13 % and the most common mutations affect less 
than 1 in 20 patients (5 %). They stated that the value of testing for germline mutations in patients with SPPs and their family members is 
unknown, as the balance of potential benefits and harms remains unclear.
