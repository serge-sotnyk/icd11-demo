chromosomes), translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22 (t[9;22]) or BCR-ABL fusion, 
translocation involving chromosomes 4 and 11 (t[4;11]) or MLL-AF4 fusion, and ProB or T-lineage 
immunophenotype. Several risk-stratification schema exist, but, in general, the following findings 
help define children at high-risk of relapse: (1) poor response to initial therapy including poor 
response to prednisone prophase defined as an absolute blast count of 1000/μL or greater, or poor 
treatment response to induction therapy at 6 weeks with high-risk having 1% or higher minimal 
residual disease measured by flow cytometry; (2) all children with T-cell phenotype; and (3) patients 
with either the t(9;22) or t(4;11) regardless of early response measures. 
 
Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
Risk factors for relapse are less well-defined in adults, but a patient with any of the following may 
be considered at high-risk for relapse: age older than 35 years, leukocytosis at presentation of greater 
than 30000/μL (B -cell lineage) or greater than 100000/μL (T -cell lineage), “poor prognosis” gen etic 
abnormalities like the Philadelphia chromosome (t[9;22]), extramedullary disease, and time to attain 
complete remission longer than 4 weeks. 
 
Reduced-Intensity Conditioning 
Some patients for whom a conventional myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation 
(HCT) could be curative may be considered candidates for reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) 
allogeneic HCT (see Background section). Such patients include those whose age (typically >60 
years) or comorbidities (eg, liver or kidney dysfunction, generalized debilitation, prior intensive 
chemotherapy including autologous or allogeneic HCT, low Karnofsky Performance Status score) 
preclude the use of a standard myeloablative conditioning regimen.

The ideal allogeneic donors are human leuko cyte antigen (HLA) ’identical siblings, matched at the 
HLA -A, -B, and DR (antigen -D related) loci on each arm of chromosome 6. Related donors 
mismatched at one locus are also considered suitable donors. A matched, unrelated donor identified 
through the Nat ional Marrow Donor Registry is typically the next option considered. Recently, there 
has been interest in haploidentical donors, typically a parent or a child of the patient, where usually 
there is sharing of only 3 of the 6 major histocompatibility antige ns. Most patients will have such a 
donor. The risk of morbidity (eg, graft -versus -host disease [GVHD]) may be higher than with HLA -
matched donors; however, as medical treatments improve, the risks of GVHD with haploidentical 
donors are approaching those si milar to HLA -matched donors.

Background/Overview  
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
 
Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer diagnosed in children; it represents 
nearly 25% of cancers in children younger than 15 years. Remission of disease is now typically 
achieved with pediatric chemotherapy regimens in 98% of children with ALL, with up to 85% long-
term survival rates. Survival rates have improved with the identification of effective drugs and 
combination chemotherapy through large randomized trials, integration of presymptomatic central 
nervous system prophylaxis, and intensification and risk-based stratification of treatment. The 
prognosis after the first relapse is related to the length of the original remission. For example, 
leukemia-free survival is 40% to 50% for children whose first remission was longer than 3 years 
compared with 10% to 15% for those who relapse less than 3 years after treatment. Thus, 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may be a strong consideration in those with short 
remissions. At present, the comparative outcomes with autologous or allogeneic HCT (allo -HCT) 
are unknown. 
 
ALL is a heterogeneous disease with different genetic variations resulting in distinct b iologic 
subtypes. Patients are stratified by certain clinical and genetic risk factors that predict an outcome, 
with risk-adapted therapy tailoring treatment based on the predicted risk of relapse. Two of the most 
important factors predictive of risk are patient age and white blood cell count at diagnosis. Certain 
genetic characteristics of leukemic cells strongly influence prognosis. Clinical and biologic factors 
predicting clinical outcomes and relapse risk are summarized in the Policy Guidelines section. 
 
Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
ALL accounts for 20% of acute leukemias in adults. Between 60% and 80% of adults with ALL can 
be expected to achieve a complete response after induction chemotherapy; however, only 35¬% to 
40% can be expected to survive 2 years. Differences in the frequency of genetic abnormalities that 
characterize adult ALL versus childhood ALL help, in part, explain differences in outcomes between 
the 2 groups. For example, the “good prognosis” genetic abnormalities, such as hyperdipl oidy and 
translocation of chromosomes 12 and 21, are seen much less commonly in adult ALL, whereas they 
are some of the most common in childhood ALL. Conversely, “poor prognosis” genetic 
abnormalities such as the Philadelphia chromosome (translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22) are

seen in 25% to 30% of adult ALL but infrequently in childhood ALL. Other adverse prognostic 
factors in adult ALL include age greater than 35 years, poor performance status, male sex, and 
leukocytosis at presentation of greater than 30000/μL (B -cell lineage) or greater than 100000/μL (T -
cell lineage). 
 
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 
HCT is a procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are intravenously infused to restore bone 
marrow and immune function in cancer patients who receive bone marrow-toxic doses of cytotoxic 
drugs with or without whole-body radiotherapy. Hematopoietic stem cells may be obtained from the 
transplant recipient (autologous HCT) or a donor (allo-HCT). They can be harvested from bone 
marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood shortly after delivery of neonates.  
 
Immunologic compatibility between infused hematopoietic stem cells and the recipient is not an 
issue in autologous HCT. In allogeneic stem cell transplantation, immunologic compatibility 
between donor and patient is a critical factor for achieving a successful outcome. Compatibility is 
established by typing of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) using cellular, serologic, or molecular 
techniques. HLA refers to the gene complex expressed at the HLA- A, -B, and -DR (antigen- D 
related) loci on each arm of chromosome 6. An acceptable donor will match the patient at all or most 
of the HLA loci. 
 
Conditioning for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 
 
Conventional Conditioning 
The conventional (“classical”) practice of allo -HCT involves administration of cytotoxic agents 
(e.g., cyclophosphamide, busulfan) with or without existing disease in the absence of pretransplant 
conditioning. Intense conditioning regimens are limited to patients whose health status is sufficient 
to tolerate the procedure of body irradiation at doses sufficient to cause bone marrow ablation in the 
recipient. The beneficial treatment effect of this procedure is due to a combination of the initial 
eradication of malignant cells and subsequent graft-versus-malignancy effect mediated by non-self-
immunologic effector cells. While the slower graft-versus-malignancy effect is considered the 
potentially curative component, it may be overwhelmed by substantial adverse effects. These include 
opportunistic infections secondary to loss of endogenous bone marrow function and organ damage 
or failure caused by cytotoxic drugs. Subsequent to graft infusion in allo-HCT, immunosuppressant

drugs are required to minimize graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which 
increases susceptibility to opportunistic infections. 
 
The success of autologous HCT is predicated on the potential of cytotoxic chemotherapy, with or 
without radiotherapy, to eradicate cancerous cells from the blood and bone marrow. This permits 
subsequent engraftment and repopulation of the bone marrow with presumably normal 
hematopoietic stem cells obtained from the patient before undergoing bone marrow ablation. 
Therefore, autologous HCT is typically performed as consolidation therapy when the patient’s 
disease is in complete remission. Patients who undergo autologous HCT are also susceptible to 
chemotherapy-related toxicities and opportunistic infections before engraftment, but not GV HD. 
 
Reduced-Intensity Conditioning Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 
Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HCT refers to the pretransplant use of lower doses 
of cytotoxic drugs or less intense regimens of radiotherapy than are used in traditional full-dose 
myeloablative conditioning treatments. Although the definition of RIC is variable, with numerous 
versions employed, all regimens seek to balance the competing effects of relapse due to residual 
disease and non-relapse mortality. The goal of RIC is to reduce disease burden and to minimize 
associated treatment-related morbidity and non-relapse mortality in the period during which the 
beneficial graft-versus-malignancy effect of allogeneic transplantation develops. RIC regimens 
range from nearly total myeloablative to minimally myeloablative with lymphoablation, with 
intensity tailored to specific diseases and patient condition. Patients who undergo RIC with allo -
HCT initially demonstrate donor cell engraftment and bone marrow mixed chimerism. Most will 
subsequently convert to full-donor chimerism. In this review, the term reduced-intensity 
conditioning will refer to all conditioning regimens intended to be nonmyeloablative.

Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer -reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines.  
 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease with different genetic variations 
resulting in distinct biologic subtypes. Patients are stratified to risk-adapted therapy according to 
certain clinical and genetic risk factors that predict an outcome. Therapy may include hematopoietic 
cell transplantation (HCT). 
 
Summary of Evidence 
For individuals who have childhood ALL in first complete remission (CR1) at high-risk of relapse, 
remission, or refractory ALL who receive autologous HCT, the evidence includes randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), 
disease-specific survival (DSS), and treatment-related mortality (TRM) and morbidity. For children 
with high-risk ALL in CR1 or with relapsed ALL, studies have suggested that HCT is associated 
with fewer relapses but higher death rates due to treatment-related toxicity. However, for a subset of 
high-risk patients in second complete remission or beyond or with relapsed disease, autologous HCT 
is a treatment option. This conclusion is further supported by an evidence-based systematic review 
and position statement from the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation 
(ASBMT). The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in 
the net health outcome.

the ASBMT. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement 
in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals who have adult ALL in CR1, subsequent remission, or refractory ALL who receive 
autologous HCT, the evidence includes RCTs and systematic reviews. Relevant outcomes are OS, 
DSS, and TRM and morbidity. Current evidence supports the use of autologous HCT for adults with 
high-risk ALL in CR1, whose health status is sufficient to tolerate the procedure. The evidence is 
sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals who have adult ALL in CR1 or subsequent remission or refractory ALL who receive 
allo-HCT, the evidence includes RCTs, systematic reviews, and observational studies. Relevant 
outcomes are OS, DSS, and TRM and morbidity. Current evidence supports the use of myeloablative 
allo-HCT for adults with any risk level ALL, whose health status is sufficient to tolerate the 
procedure. Reduced-intensity conditioning allo-HCT may be considered for patients who 
demonstrate complete marrow and extramedullary first or second remission and who could be 
expected to benefit from a myeloablative allo-HCT, but for medical reasons would not tolerate a 
myeloablative conditioning regimen. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology 
results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals who have relapsed after a prior autologous HCT for ALL who receive allo-HCT, the 
evidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are OS, DSS, and TRM and morbidity. Evidence 
reviews have identified only small case series with short-term follow-up, which was considered 
inadequate evidence of benefit. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results 
in an improvement in the net health outcome.

2013 Input 
In response to requests, input was received from 1 medical society, 2 academic medical centers, and 
3 physicians from Blue Distinction Centers while this policy was under review in 2013. In general, 
input supported most existing policy statements. However, most reviewers disagreed that allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is considered investigational to treat relapsing acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after a prior autologous HCT in either children or adults. Given a 
scarcity of evidence on this topic, with no substantial trials likely to be forthcoming, that allo -HCT 
after failed autologous HCT has been shown to be of clinical benefit in other hematologic 
malignancies and is potentially curative, and that reduced-intensity conditioning allo-HCT is 
considered medically necessary to treat ALL in second or greater remission or relapsed or refractory 
ALL, the policy statements were revised to medical necessity for this indication in children and 
adults. 
 
Practice Guidelines and Position Statements 
Guidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in ‘Supplemental Information’ if 
they were issued by, or jointly by, a US professional society, an international society with US 
representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given 
to guidelines that are informed by a systematic review, include strength of evidence ratings, and 
include a description of management of conflict of interest. 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (v.2.2021) for ALL indicate allo-HCT 
is appropriate for consolidation treatment of most poor risk (eg, the Philadelphia chromosome-
positive, relapsed, or refractory) patients with ALL. The guidelines state that for appropriately fit 
older adults with ALL who are achieving remission, “consideration of autologous or reduced -
intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation may be appropriate.” In addition, the guidelines note 
that chronologic age is not a good surrogate for fitness for therapy and that patient should be 
evaluated on an individual basis. 
 
Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (v 1.2022) for pediatric ALL say that 
"Allogeneic HSCT has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in pediatric ALL patients with 
evidence of certain high-risk features and/or persistent disease. In addition, survival rates appear to 
be comparable regardless of the stem cell source (matched related, matched unrelated, cord blood,

f) Effective for claims with dates of service on or after January 27, 2016, allogeneic HSCT for sickle 
cell disease (SCD) is covered by Medicare only for beneficiaries with severe, symptomatic SCD 
who participate in an approved prospective clinical study.... 
 
II. Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (AuSCT) 
a) Effective … 1989, AuSCT is considered reasonable and necessary … for the following conditions 
and is covered under Medicare for patients with: 
1. Acute leukemia in remission who have a high probability of relapse and who have no human 
leukocyte antigens (HLA)-matched; 
2. Resistant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas or those presenting with poor prognostic features 
following an initial response; 
3. Recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma; or, 
4. Advanced Hodgkin's disease who have failed conventional therapy and have no HLA  
matched donor. 
b) Effective … 2000, single AuSCT is only covered for Durie -Salmon Stage II or III patients that fit 
the following requirements: 
• Newly diagnosed or responsive multiple myeloma. This includes those patients with 
previously untreated disease, those with at least a partial response to prior chemotherapy 
(defined as a 50% decrease either in measurable paraprotein [serum and/or urine] or in 
bone marrow infiltration, sustained for at least 1 month), and those in responsive relapse; 
and 
• Adequate cardiac, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic function. 
 
c) Effective … 2005, when recognized clinical risk factors are employed to select patien ts for 
transplantation, high dose melphalan (HDM) together with AuSCT is reasonable and necessary for 
Medicare beneficiaries of any age group with primary amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis who 
meet the following criteria:  
• Amyloid deposition in 2 or fewer organs; and, 
• Cardiac left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) greater than 45%.”

*Investigational – A medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product is 
Investigational if the effectiveness has not been clearly tested and it has not been incorporated into 
standard medical practice. Any determination we make that a medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is Investigational will be based on a consideration of the following: 
A. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product can be 
lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
whether such approval has been granted at the time the medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is sought to be furnished; or 
B. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product requires 
further studies or clinical trials to determine its maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, safety, 
effectiveness, or effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or 
diagnosis, must improve health outcomes, according to the consensus of opinion among 
experts as shown by reliable evidence, includin g: 
1. Consultation with technology evaluation center(s); 
2. Credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community; or 
3. Reference to federal regulations. 
 
**Medically Necessary (or “Medical Necessity”) - Health care services, treatment, procedures,
