Background/Overview  
Livtencity is a cytomegalovirus (CMV) pUL97 kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adults 
and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 35 kg) with post-transplant 
CMV infection/disease that is refractory to treatment (with or without genotypic resistance) with 
ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. Livtencity is dosed 400 mg (two 200 mg tablets) 
taken twice daily with or without food. If Livtencity is co-administered with carbamazepine, the 
dosage should be increased to 800 mg twice daily. If Livtencity is co-administered with phenytoin 
or phenobarbital, the dose should be increased to 1,200 mg twice daily. Clinical trials used an 8 week 
treatment duration for Livtencity. The Livtencity package insert notes that due to antagonistic drug 
activity, coadministration of Livtencity with ganciclovir and/or valganciclovir is not recommended.  
 
CMV affects nearly 50% of the population in the United States. In individuals that have a properly 
functioning immune system, the viral infection is typically asymptomatic or there is a self-limiting 
febrile illness. This is followed by viral latency. In immunocompromised patients, CMV infection 
is associated with severe morbidity and mortality, including opportunistic infections and graft versus 
host disease. The use of prophylactic therapy (given to all “at risk” patients) and preemptive therapy 
(given to only to symptomatic patients with evidence of CMV replication) for CMV has decreased 
infections substantially. However, there is still the chance of resistance or refractory response to 
common first line anti-viral options, which include ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or 
cidofovir. Resistant and/or refractory infections carry a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality. 
Livtencity is currently the only agent approved for the treatment of post-transplant patients with 
treatment refractory CMV infection/disease. 
 
FDA or Other Governmental Regulatory Approval  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Livtencity was approved in late 2021 for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients (12 years of 
age and older and weighing at least 35 kg) with post-transplant cytomegalovirus (CMV ) 
infection/disease that is refractory to treatment (with or without genotypic resistance) with 
ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet.

Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer-reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines. 
 
Livtenci ty was evaluated in a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled 
superiority trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Livtencity compared to Investigator-Assigned 
Treatment (IAT) (ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir) in 352 hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
infections (CMV DNA of greater than or equal to 2,730 IU/mL in whole blood or greater than or 
equal to 910 IU/mL in plasma) that were refractory to treatment with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, 
foscarnet, or cidofovir, including CMV infections with or without confirmed resistance to 1 or more 
of the IATs. Refractory was defined as a documented failure to achieve greater than 1 log 10 decrease 
in CMV DNA level in whole blood or plasma after a 14 day or longer treatment period with 
ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir. Subjects were stratified by transplant type 
(HSCT or SOT) and screening CMV DNA levels and then randomized in a 2:1 allocation ratio to 
receive either Livtencity 400 mg twice daily or IAT as dosed by the investigator for up to 8 weeks. 
After completion of the treatment period, subjects entered a 12-week follow-up phase. The most 
common treatment used in the IAT arm was foscarnet which was administered in 47 (41%) subjects 
followed by ganciclovir or valganciclovir, each administered in 28 (24%) subjects. Cidofovir was 
administered in 6 subjects, the combination of foscarnet and valganciclovir in 4 subjects and the 
combination of foscarnet and ganciclovir in 3 subjects. The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed 
CMV DNA level less than the lower level of quantitation, LLOQ (i.e. < 137  IU/mL),  as assessed at 
the end of week 8. For the primary endpoint, Livtencity was statistically superior to IAT (56% vs. 
24%, respectively). The treatment effect of Livtencity was consistent across transplant type, age 
group, and the presence of CMV syndrome/disease at baseline.

*Investigational – A medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product is 
Investigational if the effectiveness has not been clearly tested and it has not been incorporated into 
standard medical practice. Any determination we make that a medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is Investigational will be based on a consideration of the following: 
A. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product can be 
lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
whether such approval has been granted at the time the medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is sought to be furnished; or 
B. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product requires 
further studies or clinical trials to determine its maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, safety, 
effectiveness, or effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or 
diagnosis, must improve health outcomes, according to the consensus of opinion among 
experts as shown by reliable evidence, including: 
1. Consultation with technology evaluation center(s); 
2. Credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community; or 
3. Reference to federal regulations.
