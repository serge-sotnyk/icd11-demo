Introduction  
Using mild electrical current is one way to treat nerve pain. It’s believed that the electrical 
signals interfere with the way nerves relay information about pain to the brain. TENS, which 
uses electricity transferred through the skin, has been in use for decades and is well proven. Newer ways of delivering small electrical impulses are being studied. Percutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation (PENS) uses small needles placed just below the skin, with electricity delivered 
by a battery-powered stimulator. In percutaneous neuromodulation therapy (PNT), fine needle 
electrodes are placed in deep tissues. Because more high-quality studies are needed  to 
determine if PENS and PNT are  effective, they are both still considered unproven.  
 
Note:   The Introduction section is for your general knowledge and is not to be taken  as policy coverage criteria. 
The rest of the policy uses specific words and concepts familiar to medical professionals. It is intended for 
providers . A provider can be a person, such as a doctor, nurse, psychologist, or dentist. A provider also can 
be a place where medical care is given, like a hospital, clinic, or lab.  This policy informs them about when a 
service may be covered.

neuromodulation therapy is considered investigational.  
 
Guidelines  
Percutaneous electrical neurostimulation (PENS) and percutaneous neuromodulation  
therapy  (PNT) use percutaneously inserted needles and wires rather than percutaneously 
implanted electrodes. The stimulation devices used in PENS  and PNT are not implanted .

Description 
Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) and percutaneous neuromodulation therapy 
(PNT)  combine the features of electroacupuncture and transcutaneous electrical nerve Page | 3 of 12                                                                         ∞ stimulation (TENS) . PENS is performed with needle electrodes while PNT uses very fine needle-
like electrode arrays placed near the painful area to stimulate peripheral sensory nerves in the 
soft tissue. 
 
Background  
Chronic Pain  
A variety of chronic musculoskeletal or neuropathic pain conditions, including low back pain, 
neck pain, diabetic neuropathy, chronic headache, and surface hyperalgesia, presents a 
substantial burden to patients, adversely affecting function and quality of life. Certain racial and 
ethnic groups are at a higher risk of developing diabetes, which may also put them at higher risk of developing complications from diabetes, such as diabetic neuropathy. According to a 2018 to 2019 National Health Interview Survey and data from the Indian Health Service 
National Data Warehouse, American Indians and Alaska Natives had the highest reported rate 
of diagnosed diabetes at 14.5%.
1 This was followed by 12.1% of Black individuals, 11.8% of 
Hispanic individuals, 9.5% of Asian individuals, and 7.4% of White individuals having diagnosed diabetes in 2018 or 2019. 
 Treatment  
These chronic pain conditions have typically failed other treatments, and PENS  and PNT have 
been evaluated as treatments to relieve unremitting pain. 
PENS is similar in concept to TENS  (see Related Policies ) but differs in that needles are 
inserted either around or immediately adjacent to the nerves serving the painful area and are 
then stimulated. PENS is generally reserved for patients who fail to get pain relief from TENS. 
PENS is also distinguished  from acupuncture with electrical stimulation. In electrical 
acupuncture, needles are also inserted just below the skin, but the placement of needles is based on specific theories regarding energy flow throughout the human body. In PENS, the location of stimulation is determined  by proximity to the pain. 
PNT is  a variant of PENS in which fine filament electrode arrays are placed near the area that is 
causing pain. Some use the terms PENS and PNT interchangeably. It is proposed that PNT inhibits pain transmission by creating an electrical field that hyperpolarizes C -fibers, thus 
preventing action potential propagation along the pain pathway. Page | 4 of 12                                                                         ∞  
Summary of Evidence  
For individuals who have chronic pain conditions ( e.g., back, neck, neuropathy, headache, 
hyperalgesia) who receive PENS, the evidence includes primarily small controlled trials  and a 
two systematic review s. The relevant outcomes are symptoms, functional outcomes, quality of 
life, and medication use. Two systematic review s have not revealed consistent benefit from 
PENS  in musculoskeletal pain disorders. One review concluded that PENS could decrease pain 
intensity but not related disability, while the other found no significant differences between 
PENS and TENS in mitigation of pain. These conclusions are uncertain due to important 
methodological limitations in individual trials included in these reviews, such as high 
heterogeneity with regard to application methods. In the highest quality trial of PENS 
conducted to date  in chronic l ow back pain , no difference in outcomes was found between the 
active (30 minutes of stimulation with 10 needles) and the sham (5 minutes of stimulation with 2 needles) treatments. Smaller trials, which have reported positive results, are limited by unclear 
blinding and short-term follow -up. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the 
technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
For individuals who have chronic pain conditions ( e.g., knee osteoarthritis) who receive PNT, the 
evidence consists of a randomized controlled trial. The relevant outcomes are symptoms, 
functional outcomes, quality of life, and medication use. The single trial is limited by lack of investigator blinding, unclear participant blinding, and short -term follow -up. The evidence is 
insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health 
outcome.

Clinical Input Received from Physician Specialty Societies and Academic 
Medical Centers  
While the various physician specialty societies and academic medical centers may collaborate 
with and make recommendations during this process, through the provision of appropriate 
reviewers, input  received does not represent an endorsement or position statement by the 
physician specialty societies or academic medical centers, unless otherwise noted.  
 
2011 Input 
In response to requests, input was received from five  physician specialty societies and two 
academic medical centers while this policy was under review in 2011. I nput was mixed on 
whether PENS  and PNT should be considered investigational or medically necessary.

Guidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion if they were issued by, or 
jointly by, a U.S. professional society, an international society with U.S. representation, or 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines that 
are informed by a systematic review, include strength of evidence ratings, and include a 
description of management of conflict of interest. 
 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (2013)  publi shed guidance on PENS .37 It 
concluded that the “C urrent evidence on the safety of percuta neous electrical nerve stimulation 
(PENS ) for refractory neuropathic pain raises no major safety concerns and there is evidence of 
efficacy in the short term.”   
 
American Academy of Neurology et al  
The American Academy of Neurology, the American Association of Neuromuscular and 
Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation 
reaffirmed 2011 evidence- based guidelines on the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy in 
2016.38 The guidelines concluded that, based on a c lass I study, electrical stimulation is 
probably effective in lessening the pain of diabetic neuropathy and improving quality of life 
and recommended that PENS be considered for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy 
(level B). The guidelines were retired and replaced in 2022 with a guideline dedicated to oral 
and topical treatment of painful diabetic polyneuropathy.39 In these updated guidelines, there 
is no mention of any electrical stimulation strategies for pain. 
 
American Society of Anesthesiologists et al 
The 2010 p ractice guidelines for chronic pain management from the American Society of 
Anesthesiologists and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine indicated that subcutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation might be used in the multimodal 
treatment of patients with painful peripheral nerve injuries who have not responded to other 
therapies ( category B2 evidence, observational studies).

American College of Physicians and American Pain Society  
Joint practice guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain from the American 
College of Physicians and the American Pain Society in 2007 indicated uncertainty over whether 
PENS should be considered a novel therapy or a form of electroacupuncture.41 The guidelines 
concluded that PENS is not widely available. The guidelines also concluded that TENS  has not 
been proven effective for chronic low back pain. These guidelines were updated in 2017 and 
authors stated that evidence was insufficient to determine harms associated with PENS thus, no recommendation was made.
42 
Medicare National Coverage  
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) currently has the following national coverage policy on PENS
43: 
Electrical nerve stimulation is an accepted modality for assessing a patient's suitability for ongoing treatment with a transcutaneous or an implanted nerve stimulator.  
Accordingly, program payment may be made for the following techniques when used to 
determine the potential therapeutic usefulness of an electrical nerve stimulator... 
B. Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (PENS ) 
The diagnostic procedure which involves stimulation of peripheral nerves by a needle 
electrode inserted through the skin is performed only in a physician's office, clinic, or 
hospital outpatient department. Therefore, it is covered only when performed by a 
physician or incident to physician's service. If pain is effectively controlled by percutaneous 
stimulation, implantation of electrodes is warranted.  
[It] is inappropriate for a patient to visit his/her physician, physical therapist, or an 
outpatient clinic on a continuing basis for treatment of pain with electrical nerve stimulation. Once it is determined that electrical nerve stimulation should be continued as 
therapy and the patient has been trained to use the stimulator, it is expected that a stimulator will be implanted or the patient will employ the TENS on a continual basis in 
his/her home. Electrical nerve stimulation treatments furnished by a physician in his/her 
office, by a physical therapist or outpatient clinic are excluded from coverage.

• In 2002, the Percutaneous Neuromodulation Therapy™ (Vertis Neuroscience) was cleared 
for marketing  by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  through the 510(k) process. 
The labeled indication is: “… for the symptomatic relief and management of chronic or 
intractab le pain and/or as an adjunctive treatment in the management of post -surgical pain 
and post -trauma pain.”  
• In 2006, the Deepwave® Percutaneous Neuromodulation Pain Therapy System (Biowave) 
was cleared for marketing by FDA through the 510(k) process. The FDA determined that this 
device was substantially equivalent to the Vertis neuromodulation system and a Biowave neuromodulation therapy unit. The Deepwave® system includes a sterile single- use 
percutaneous electrode array that contains 1,014 microneedles in a 1.5-inch diameter area. 
The needles are 736 μm (0.736 mm) in length; the patch is reported to feel like sandpaper or Velcro.
