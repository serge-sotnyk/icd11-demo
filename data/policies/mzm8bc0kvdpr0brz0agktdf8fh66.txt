The Company reserves the right to modify the Dosing and Frequency Requirements listed in this Policy to ensure consistency with the most recently
published recommendations for the use ofÂ 
ipilimumab (Yervoy). Changes to these guidelines are based on a consensus of information obtained from
resources such as, but not limited to: the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); Company-recognized authoritative pharmacology compendia; or

order to request coverage for an amount ofÂ

Company-recognized pharmacology compendia, view our policy on off-label coverage for prescription drugs and biologics.
Accurate member information is necessary for the Company to approve the requested dose and frequency of this drug. If the memberâ€™s dose,
frequency, or regimen changes (based on factors such as changes in member weight or incomplete therapeutic response), the providerÂ 
must
Â submit
those changes to the Company for a new approval based on those changes as part of the precertification process.Â 
The Company reserves the right to
conduct post-payment review and audit procedures for any claims submitted forÂ 
ipilimumab (Yervoy).
