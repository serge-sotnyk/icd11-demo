• No active gastric antral vascular ectasia; AND  
• Progression of disease despite treatment with immunosuppressive therapies like 
mycophenolate mofetil.  
 
Notes 
• Medical records will need to be provided, including but not limited to history of disease and 
previous treatment, recent Modified Rodnan Scale Score, pulmonary function testing (PFT) 
including diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCo) and serial forced vital capacity 
(FVC) measurements, high resolution chest CT report, renal function and heart testing 
reports. 
• Autologous HCT should be considered for patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) only if the 
condition is rapidly progressing and the prognosis for survival is poor. An important factor 
influencing the occurrence of treatment -related adverse effects and response to treatment is 
the level of internal organ involvement. If organ involvement is severe and irreversible, HCT 
is not recommended.  
• Modified Ro dnan Scale Score: This score consists of an evaluation of patient’s skin thickness 
rated by clinical palpation using a 0 –3 scale (0=normal skin; 1=mild thickness; 2=moderate 
thickness; 3=severe thickness with inability to pinch the skin into a fold) for ea ch of 17 
surface anatomic areas of the body: face, anterior chest, abdomen, (right and left separately), 
fingers, forearms, upper arms, thighs, lower legs, dorsum of hands and feet. These individual 
values are added and the sum is defined as the total skin  score.

Background/Overview  
Autoimmune Disease Treatment 
Immune suppression is a common treatment strategy for many of these diseases, particularly 
rheumatic diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma). Most 
patients with autoimmune disorders respond to conventional therapies, which consist of anti-
inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, and immunomodulating drugs; however, conventional 
drug therapies are not curative, and a proportion of patients suffer from autoimmune diseases that 
range from severe to recalcitrant to rapidly progressive. It is for this group of patients with severe 
autoimmune disease that alternative therapies have been sought, including hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT). The primary concept underlying the use of HCT for these diseases is this: 
ablating and “resetting” the im mune system can alter the disease process by inducing a sustained 
remission that possibly leads to cure.  
 
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 
HCT is a procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are intravenously infused to restore bone 
marrow and immune function in cancer patients who receive bone marrow-toxic doses of cytotoxic 
drugs with or without whole-body radiotherapy. Hematopoietic stem cells may be obtained from the 
transplant recipient (autologous HCT) or a donor (allogeneic HCT [allo-HCT]). They can be 
harvested from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood shortly after delivery of 
neonates.  
 
Immunologic compatibility between infused hematopoietic stem cells and the recipient is not an 
issue in autologous HCT. In allogeneic stem cell transplantation, immunologic compatibility 
between donor and patient is a critical factor for achieving a successful outcome. Compatibility is 
established by typing of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) using cellular, serologic, or molecular 
techniques. HLA refers to the gene complex expressed at the HLA-A, -B, and -DR (antigen- D

related) loci on each arm of chromosome six. An acceptable donor will match the patient at all or 
most of the HLA loci. 
 
Conditioning for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 
Conventional Conditioning 
The conventional (“classical”) practice of allo -HCT involves administration of cytotoxic agents 
(e.g., cyclophosphamide, busulfan) with or without total body irradiation at doses sufficient to cause 
bone marrow ablation in the recipient. The beneficial treatment effect of this procedure is due to a 
combination of the initial eradication of malignant cells and subsequent graft-versus-malignancy 
(GVM) effect mediated by non-self-immunologic effector cells. While the slower GVM effect is 
considered the potentially curative component, it may be overwhelmed by existing disease in the 
absence of pretransplant conditioning. Intense conditioning regimens are limited to patients who are 
sufficiently medically fit to tolerate substantial adverse effects. These include opportunistic 
infections secondary to loss of endogenous bone marrow function and organ damage or failure 
caused by cytotoxic drugs. Subsequent to graft infusion in allo-HCT, immunosuppressant drugs are 
required to minimize graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease, which increases susceptibility to 
opportunistic infections. 
 
The success of autologous HCT is predicated on the potential of cytotoxic chemotherapy, with or 
without radiotherapy, to eradicate cancerous cells from the blood and bone marrow. This permits 
subsequent engraftment and repopulation of the bone marrow with presumably normal 
hematopoietic stem cells obtained from the patient before undergoing bone marrow ablation. 
Therefore, autologous HCT is typically performed as consolidation therapy when the patient’s 
disease is in complete remission. Patients who undergo autologous HCT are also susceptible to 
chemotherapy-related toxicities and opportunistic infections before engraftment, but not GVH 
disease. 
 
Reduced-Intensity Conditioning Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 
Reduced-Intensity Conditioning (RIC) refers to the pretransplant use of lower doses of cytotoxic 
drugs or less intense regimens of radiotherapy than are used in traditional full-dose myeloablative 
conditioning treatments. Although the definition of RIC is variable, with numerous versions 
employed, all regimens seek to balance the competing effects of relapse due to residual disease and 
non-relapse mortality. The goal of RIC is to reduce disease burden and to minimize associated 
treatment-related morbidity and non-relapse mortality in the period during which the beneficial

GVM effect of allogeneic transplantation develops. RIC regimens range from nearly total 
myeloablative to minimally myeloablative with lymphoablation, with intensity tailored to specific 
diseases and patient condition. Patients who undergo RIC with allo -HCT initially demonstrate donor 
cell engraftment and bone marrow mixed chimerism. Most will subsequently convert to full -donor 
chime rism. In this review, the term reduced -intensity conditioning  will refer to all conditioning 
regimens intended to be nonmyeloablative.  
 
FDA or Other Governmental Regulatory Approval  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
The FDA regulates human cells and tissues intended for implantation, transplantation, or infusion 
through the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, under Code of Federal Regulation title 
21, parts 1270 and 1271. Hematopoietic stem cells are included in these regulations. 
 
Ratio nale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer-reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines. 
 
Most patients with autoimmune disorders respond to conventional drug therapies; however, 
conventional drug therapies are not curative-and a proportion of patients suffer from autoimmune 
diseases that range from the severe to the recalcitrant to the rapidly progressive. It is in this group of 
patients with severe autoimmune disease that alternative therapies have been sought, including HCT. 
 
For individuals with multiple sclerosis who receive HCT, the evidence includes 2 randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and several nonrandomized studies. Relevant outcomes 
are overall survival (OS), health status measures, quality of life (QOL), and treatment-related 
mortality (TRM) and morbidity. One RCT compared HCT with mitoxantrone, and the trial reported 
intermediate outcomes (number of new T2 magnetic resonance imaging lesions); the group 
randomized to HCT developed significantly fewer lesions than the group receiving conventional 
therapy. The other RCT compared nonmyeloablative HCT results in patients with continued disease-
modifying therapy and found a benefit to HCT in prolonged time to disease progression. The findings

of the nonrandomized studies revealed improvements in clinical parameters following HCT 
compared with baseline. Adverse event rates were high, and most studies reported treatment -related  
deaths. Controlled trials (with appropriate comparator therapies) reporting on clinical outcomes are 
needed to demonstrate efficacy. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results 
in an improvement in the net health outcome.  
 
For individuals with systemic sclerosis/scleroderma who receive HCT, the evidence includes 3 RCTs 
and observational studies. The R elevant  outcomes are OS, symptoms, health status measures, QOL, 
and TRM  and morbidity. All 3 RCTs compared cyclophosphamide condit ioning plus autologous 
HCT with cyclophosphamide alone. Patients in the RCTs were adults <60 years of age, maximum  
duration of disease of 5 years, with modified Rodnan skin scores >15, and internal organ 
involvement. Patients with severe and irreversible o rgan involvement were excluded from the trials. 
Short -term results of the RCTs show higher rates of adverse events and TRM  among patients 
receiving autologous HCT compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone. However, long -
term improvements (four ye ars) in clinical outcomes such as modified Rodnan skin scores  and forced 
vital capacity, as well as overall mortality in patients receiving HCT compared with patients 
receiving cyclophosphamide alone, were  consistently reported in all RCTs. Due to sample s ize 
limitations in 2 of the RCTs, statistical significance was found only in the larger RCT. The evidence 
is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in net health 
outcomes.  
 
For individuals with systemic lupus erythe matosus who receive HCT, the evidence includes a 
systematic review and case series. The relevant  outcomes are OS, symptoms, QOL , and TRM  and 
morbidity. Studies were heterogeneous in conditioning regimens and source of cells. The largest 
series (n=50) repor ted an overall 5 -year survival rate of 84% and the probability of disease -free 
survival was 50%. Additional data are needed from controlled studies to demonstrate efficacy. The 
evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health o utcomes.  
 
For individuals with juvenile idiopathic or rheumatoid arthritis who receive HCT, the evidence 
includes registry data and a case series. The relevant  outcomes are OS, symptoms, QOL , and TRM  
and morbidity. The registry included 50 patients with ju venile idiopathic or rheumatoid arthritis. The 
overall drug -free remission rate was approximately 50% in the registry patients and 69% in the 
smaller case series. Additional data are needed from controlled studies to demonstrate efficacy. The 
evidence is i nsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes.

For individuals with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy who receive HCT, the 
evidence includes 1 observational study and case reports. Relevant outcomes are OS, symptoms, 
health status measures, QOL, and TRM and morbidity. Additional data are needed from controlled 
studies to demonstrate efficacy. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results 
in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals with type 1 diabetes who receive HCT, the evidence includes case series and 2 meta-
analyses. Relevant outcomes are OS, symptoms, health status measures, QOL, and TRM and 
morbidity. While a substantial proportion of patients tended to become insulin -free after HCT, 
remission rates were high. The meta-analyses revealed that HCT may improve HbA1 and C-peptide 
levels compared with baseline values and compared with insulin. One meta-analysis found that HCT 
is more effective in patients with type 1 diabetes compared with type 2 diabetes, and when the 
treatment is administered soon after the diagnosis. Certain factors limit the conclusions that can be 
drawn about the overall effectiveness of HCT in treating diabetes; those factors are heterogeneity in 
the stem cell types, cell number infused, and infusion methods. The evidence is insufficient to 
determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals with other autoimmune diseases (eg, Crohn disease, immune cytopenias, relapsing 
polychondritis) who receive HCT, the evidence includes 1 RCT and small retrospective studies. 
Relevant outcomes are OS, symptoms, health status measures, QOL, and TRM and morbidity. The 
RCT was conducted on patients with Crohn disease. At 1 year follow-up, 1 patient in the control 
group and 2 patients in the HCT group achieved remission. Data are needed from additional 
controlled studies to demonstrate efficacy. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the 
technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.

A. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product can be 
lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
whether such approval has been granted at the time the medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is sought to be furnished; or 
B. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product requires 
further studies or clinical trials to determine its maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, safety, 
effectiveness, or effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or 
diagnosis, must improve health outcomes, according to the consensus of opinion among 
experts as shown by reliable evidence, including: 
1. Consultation with technology evaluation center(s); 
2. Credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community; or

**Medically Necessary (or “Medical Necessity”) - Health care services, treatment, procedures, 
equipment, drugs, devices, items or supplies that a Provider, exercising prudent clinical judgment, 
would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, evaluating, diagnosing or treating an illness, 
injury, disease or its symptoms, and that are: 
A. In accordance with nationally accepted standards of medical practice; 
B. Clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, level of care, site and duration, 
and considered effective for the patient's illness, injury or disease; and

treatment of that patient's illness, injury or disease. 
For these purposes, “nationally accepted standards of medical practice” means standards that are 
based on credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally
