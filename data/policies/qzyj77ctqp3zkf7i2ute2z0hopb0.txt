Services Are Considered Investigational  
Coverage is not available for investigational medical treatments or procedures, drugs, devices or 
biological products. 
 
Based on review of available data, the Company considers general genetic cancer susceptibility 
panel testing to be investigational;*  however, when the coverage criteria of other policies are met 
(see related policies above), then limited genetic cancer susceptibility panels including only the gene 
variants for which a given member qualifies may be considered to be eligible for coverage.** 
 
Policy Guidelines  
Genetics Nomenclature Update 
The Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found 
in DNA and serves as an international standard in DNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for 
genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society’s 
nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human Genome Organization, 
and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. 
 
The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular 
Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert opinion 
from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These 
recommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, 
single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended standard 
terminology −“pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely benign,” and 
“benign” -to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders.

Genetic Counseling 
Genetic counseling is primarily aimed at individuals who are at risk for inherited disorders, and 
experts recommend formal genetic counseling in most cases when genetic testing for an inherited 
condition is considered. The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of 
risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals 
in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, including the possible impact of 
the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic 
testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed 
by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic medicine and genetic testing methods. 
 
Background/Overview  
Genetic Testing for Cancer Susceptibility 
Genetic testing for cancer susceptibility may be approached by a focused method that involves 
testing for gene(s) that may be the cause of the heritable or familial cancer. Panel testing with next-
generation sequencing (NGS) involves evaluating sequence variants in multiple genes at one time.

Multiple commercial companies and medical center laboratories offer genetic testing panels that use 
NGS methods for hereditary cancers. Next-generation sequencing is one of several methods that use 
massively parallel platforms to allow the sequencing of large stretches of DNA. Panel testing is 
potentially associated with greater efficiencies in the evaluation of genetic diseases; however, it may 
provide information on genetic variants of uncertain clinical significance or findings that would not 
lead to changes in patient management. 
 
Genes Included in Next-Generation Sequencing Panels 
The following summarizes the function and disease association of major genes included in NGS 
panels. This summary is not comprehensive. 
 
BRCA1  and BRCA2  Variants 
BRCA1  and BRCA2  germline variants are associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer 
syndrome, which is associated most strongly with increased susceptibility to breast cancer at an early 
age, bilateral breast cancer, male breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cancer of the fallopian tube, and 
primary peritoneal cancer. BRCA1  and BCRA2  variants are also associated with increased risk of 
other cancers, including prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, melanoma, and 
laryngeal cancer. 
 
APC  Variants 
APC  germline variants are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and attenuated 
FAP. Familial adenomatous polyposis is an autosomal dominant colon cancer predisposition 
syndrome characterized by hundreds to thousands of colorectal adenomatous polyps and accounts 
for about 1% of all colorectal cancers (CRCs). 
 
ATM  Variants 
ATM is associated with the autosomal recessive condition ataxia-telangiectasia. This condition is 
characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia with onset between the ages of 1 and 4 years, 
telangiectasias of the conjunctivae, oculomotor apraxia, immune defects, and cancer predisposition, 
particularly leukemia and lymphoma. 
 
BARD1, BRIP1, MRE11A, NBN, RAD50 , and RAD51C  Variants 
BARD1, BRIP1 , MRE11A , NBN , RAD50 , and RAD51C  are genes in the Fanconi anemia/ BRCA 
pathway. Variants in these genes are estimated to confer up to a 4-fold increase in the risk of breast

cancer. This pathway is also associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and, less often, pancreatic 
cancer. 
 
BMPR1A  and SMAD4 Variants 
BMPR1A  and SMAD4  are genes mutated in juvenile polyposis syndrome and account for 45% to 
60% of cases. Juvenile polyposis syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes to 
the development of polyps in the gastrointestinal tract. Malignant transformation can occur, and the 
risk of gastrointestinal cancer has been estimated from 9% to 50%. 
 
CHEK2  Variants 
CHEK2  gene variants confer an increased risk of developing several different types of cancer, 
including breast, prostate, colon, thyroid, and kidney. CHEK2  regulates the function of the BRCA1 
protein in DNA repair and has been associated with familial breast cancers. 
 
CDH1  Variants  
CDH1 is a tumor suppressing gene located on chromosome 16q22.1 that encodes the cell -to-cell 
adhesion protein E -cadherin. Germline variants in the CDH1 gene have been associated with an 
increased risk of developing hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) and lobular breast cancer. A 
diagnosis of HDGC can be confirmed by ge netic testing, although 20% to 40% of families with 
suspected HDGC do not have a CDH1 variant on genetic testing. Pathogenic CDH1 variants have 
been described in Maori families in New Zealand, and individuals of Maori ethnicity have a higher 
prevalence of diffuse -type gastric cancer than non -Maori New Zealanders . CDH1 germline variants 
are associated with lobular breast cancer in women and with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer 
(DGC) . The estimated cumulative risk of gastric cancer for CDH1 variant carriers by age 80 years 
is 70% for men and 56% for women. CDH1 variants are associated with a lifetime risk of 39% to 
52% of lobular breast cancer.  
 
EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2  Variants 
EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6, and  PMS2  are mismatch repair genes associated with Lynch 
syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis CRC). Lynch syndrome is estimated to cause 2% to 5% of all 
colon cancers. Lynch syndrome is associated with a significantly increased risk of several types of 
cancer-colon cancer (60% to 80% lifetime risk), uterine/endometrial cancer (20% to 60% lifetime 
risk), gastric cancer (11% to 19% lifetime risk), and ovarian cancer (4% to 13% lifetime risk). The

endometrium. Affected persons have a lifetime risk of up to 50% for breast cancer, 10% for thyroid 
cancer, and 5% to 10% for endometrial cancer. 
 
STK11 Variants 
STK11  germline variants are associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an autosomal dominant 
disorder, with a 57% to 81% risk of developing cancer by age 70, of which gastrointestinal and 
breast cancers are the most common. 
 
TP53  Variants 
TP53 variants are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. People with TP53 variants have a 50% 
risk of developing any of the associated cancers by age 30 and a lifetime risk up to 90%, including 
sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, and adrenal gland cancers. 
 
NF1  Variants 
The NF1 gene encodes a negative regulator in the ras signal transduction pathway. Variants in the 
NF1 gene have been associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, 
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, brain cancer, breast cancer, and Watson syndrome.

FDA or Other Governmental Regulatory Approval  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Clinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory 
service; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests must be 
licensed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, 
the U.S. FDA has chosen not to require any regulatory review of these tests. 
 
Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer-reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines.

of these variants are associated with inherited cancer syndromes. The cancer type(s), as well as a 
cancer history involving multiple family members,  increase the clinical concern for the presence of 
a heritable genetic variant. It has been proposed that variant testing using next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) technology to analyze multiple genes at one time (panel testing) can optimize genetic testing 
in these patients compared with sequencing single genes. 
 
There is limited evidence on clinical validity for many of the genes in expanded panels. Most studies 
have been retrospective. These studies have reported on the frequency with which well-known 
cancer susceptibility variants are identified using large panels and variably have reported the VUS 
rate. The VUS rates increased in proportion with panel size, reaching nearly 50% for large gene 
panels. Although it may be possible to evaluate the clinical validity of some of the genes found on 
these panels, the clinical validity of expanded cancer susceptibility panels, which include variants 
associated with unknown or variable cancer risk, are of uncertain clinical validity. 
 
Data are lacking for the clinical utility of multi-gene panels for inherited cancer susceptibility panels. 
There are management guidelines for syndromes with high penetrance, which have clinical utility in 
that they inform clinical decision making and result in the prevention of adverse health outcomes. 
Clinical management recommendations for the inherited conditions associated with low- to-moderate 
penetrance are not standardized, and the clinical utility of genetic testing for these variants is 
uncertain and could potentially lead to harm. Also, high VUS rates have been reported with the use 
of these panels. 
 
Summary of Evidence 
For individuals who have a personal and/or family history suggesting an inherited cancer syndrome 
who receive expanded gene panel testing, the evidence includes reports describing the diagnostic 
yield of expanded gene panels. Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease-specific survival, 
and test validity. Studies of gene panel testing for genetic cancer risk assessment have reported 
primarily on the frequency with which variants are identified. The rates of variants of uncertain 
significance for gene panels are significant and increase in proportion with panel size, reaching 
nearly 50% for large gene panels. Variants included in these panels are associated with varying levels 
of risk of developing cancer. Published data on clinical utility are lacking, and it is unknown whether 
the use of these panels improves health outcomes. Only some variants included on panels are 
associated with a high risk of developing a well-defined cancer syndrome for which there are 
established clinical management guidelines. Many expanded panels include genetic variants

considered to be of moderate or low penetrance, and clinical management recommendations for 
these genes are not well -defined. The lack of clinical management pathways for variants of uncertain 
clinical significa nce increases the potential for harm. The evidence is insufficient to determine that 
the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.  
 
Supplemental Information  
The purpose of the following information is to provide reference material. Inclusion does not imply 
endorsement or alignment with the evidence review conclusions. 
 
Practice Guidelines and Position Statements 
Guidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in ‘Supplemental Information’ if 
they were issued by, or jointly by, a US professional society, an international society with US 
representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given 
to guidelines that are informed by a systematic review, include strength of evidence ratings, and 
include a description of management of conflict of interest. 
 
American Society of Clinical Oncology 
In 2015, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) issued a policy statement on genetic 
and genomic testing for cancer susceptibility. The update addressed the application of next-
generation sequencing (NGS) and confirmed that panel testing may also identify variants in genes 
associated with moderate or low cancer risks, variants in high-penetrance genes that would not have 
been evaluated based on the presenting personal or family history, and variants of uncertain 
significance in a substantial proportion of patient cases. Further, the statement indicated there is little 
consensus as to which genes should be included on panels for cancer susceptibility testing. 
 
In 2020, ASCO published a guideline on germline and somatic tumor testing in epithelial ovarian 
cancer. Based on a systematic review of evidence and expert panel input, ASCO recommended that 
women with epithelial ovarian cancer should be offered germline testing for BRCA1/2  and other 
specified ovarian susceptibility genes with a multi-gene panel. It was considered more practical to 
evaluate a minimum of the 10 genes that have been associated with inherited risk of ovarian cancer 
in a panel in comparison to testing BRCA1 and BRCA2  alone.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
Breast and Ovarian Cancers  
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on genetic/familial high-risk 
assessment for breast, ovarian cancers, and/or pancreatic cancer (v.2.2022) include the following on 
multi-gene testing: 
• "An individual's personal and/or family history may be explained by more than one 
inherited cancer syndrome; thus, phenotype-directed testing based on personal and family 
history through a tailored multi-gene panel test is often more efficient and cost-effective 
and increases the yield of detecting a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in a gene that 
will impact medical management for the individual or their at-risk family members. 
• There may also be a role for multi-gene testing in individuals who have tested negative for 
a single syndrome, but whose personal or family history remains suggestive of an inherited 
susceptibility. 
• Some individuals may carry a pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants in more than 
one cancer susceptibility gene..." 
 
The NCCN defines a "tailored" multi-gene panel test as a "disease-focused multi-gene panel of 
clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes, in contrast to large multi-gene panels of uncertain 
or unknown clinical relevance."  The NCCN cautions that multi-gene panels may include moderate-
risk genes that have limited data on the degree of cancer risk and no clear guidelines on risk 
management. As more genes are testing, the likelihood of finding variants of uncertain significance 
increases. Multi-gene panel testing also increases the likelihood of finding pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic variants without clear significance.

The NCCN guidelines on genetic/familial high-risk assessment for colorectal cancer (v.1.2022) state 
that “when more than one gene can explain an inherited cancer syndrome, multi -gene testing is more 
efficient than single- gene testing, or sequential single syndrome testing" and “there is also a role for 
multi-gene testing in individuals who have tested negative (indeterminate) for a single syndrome, 
but whose personal or family history remains strongly suggestive of an inherited susceptibility." 
However, the NCCN cautioned about the increased likelihood of finding variants of uncertain 
significance, which increases with the number of genes included in the panel, and that gene panels 
can include moderate-risk genes that may not be clinically actionable.

Collaborative Group of the Americas on Inherited Gastrointestinal Cancer 
In 2020, the Collaborative Group of the Americas on Inherited Gastrointestinal Cancer published a 
position statement on multi-gene panel testing for patients with colorectal cancer and/or polyposis. 
Recommendations were based on the evidence, professional society recommendations endorsing 
testing of a given gene, and opinion of the expert panel. The group noted the variability in genes 
included in commercially available panels and recommended that multi-gene panels include a 
minimum of 11 specific genes associated with defective mismatch repair (Lynch syndrome) and 
polyposis syndromes. Additional genes to be considered had low to moderately increased risk, had 
limited data of colorectal cancer risk, or causation for colorectal cancer was not proven. 
 
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations 
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2019) has recommended that primary care providers 
screen women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who 
have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutations with an appropriate brief familial risk 
assessment tool. Women with positive screening results should receive genetic counseling and if 
indicated after counseling, BRCA  testing (grade B recommendation). The use of genetic cancer 
susceptibility panels was not specifically mentioned. 
 
Medicare National Coverage 
In January 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that NGS is 
covered for patients with breast or ovarian cancer when the diagnostic test is performed in a Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)- certified laboratory AND the test has approval or 
clearance by the U.S. FDA (CAG-00450R). 
 
CMS states that local Medicare carriers may determine coverage of NGS for management of the 
patient for any cancer diagnosis with a clinical indication and risk factor for germline testing of 
hereditary cancers when performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
