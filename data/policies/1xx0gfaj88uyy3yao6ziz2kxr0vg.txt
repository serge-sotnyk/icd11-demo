I.Aetna considers open chest, and thoracoscopic 
approaches to transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR) medically necessary for the treatment of medically refractory, severe  intractable angina (see 
Appendix for selection criteria). 
Aetna considers open chest and thoracoscopic 
approaches to TMLR experimental and investigational

Background 
Refractory angina in coronary artery disease is defined as the 
persistence of severe anginal symptoms despite maximal 
conventional anti-anginal combination therapy. Furthermore, 
the option to use an invasive revascularization procedure such as percutaneous coronary balloon angioplasty or aorto- 
coronary bypass grafting must be excluded on the basis of a 
recent coronary angiogram. This coronary syndrome, which 
represents end-stage coronary artery disease, is characterized 
by severe coronary insufficiency but only moderately impaired left ventricular function. About 70 % of the cases demonstrate 
severe coronary triple-vessel disease with diffuse coronary 
atherosclerosis, have had 1 or more myocardial infarctions, 
and have undergone aorto-coronary bypass grafting.

3/18/2021 Transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR) has emerged 
as a promising therapy for patients with end-stage coronary 
artery disease not amenable to other forms of therapy. It is a surgical technique typically performed through a left 
thoracotomy, which uses a laser to bore 15 to 30 transmural 
channels from the epicardial to the endocardial surfaces 
through the left ventricular myocardium of the beating heart in 
an attempt to improve local perfusion to ischemic myocardial territories not being reached by diseased arteries. The precise 
workings of this technique are not certain. The original theory 
upon which the technique was based, that the open channels 
would result in increased perfusion of the myocardium, does 
not appear to be the major or only action at work. Several 
theories have been proposed, including partial denervation of 
the myocardium, or the triggering of the cascade of biological reactions that encourage increased development of blood 
vessels. There are reports in the medical literature of TMLR 
being performed through a thoracoscopic approach, and pilot 
studies are underway using a percutaneous, catheter-based 
system, which allows creation of channels from the endocardial surface of the left ventricle into the myocardium. 
Medicare began covering TMLR as of July 1, 1999 based on 
research at several medical centers indicating that this 
technique does offer relief of angina symptoms for a period of 
time in patients for whom no other treatment offering relief is 
available. Early results from non-randomized and randomized controlled trials of TMLR show both a significant reduction in 
pain, a reduction in hospitalizations, and a resumption of some 
normal activities of daily living for most patients treated. HCFA 
concluded, therefore, that such studies offer sufficient 
evidence of medical effectiveness for TMLR as a late or last 
resort treatment of the symptomatology. It is important to note 
that this technique has not been shown to increase life expectancy, nor is it proven to affect the underlying cause of 
the angina. With appropriate patient selection and peri- 
operative management, TMLR is associated with a very low 
operative risk.

3/18/2021 Dallan and colleagues (2008) tested the hypothesis that TMLR
combined with intra-myocardial injection of autologous bone 
marrow cells (BMC) is safe, and may help increase the functional capacity of patient with refractory angina. A total of 
9 patients (8 men, 1 woman, mean age of 6 +/- 5 years) with 
refractory angina for multi-vessel disease and previous 
myocardial re-vascularization  procedures such as coronary 
artery bypass grafting (CABG)/percutaneous coronary 
intervention, and who not further surgical candidates due to 
the extension of the disease were enrolled.  Transmyocardial 
laser revascularization (11 +/- 3 laser drills) was performed viaa limited thoracotomy using a CO2 Heart Laser System.  
Autologous bone marrow cells were obtained immediately prior to surgery, and the lymphomonocytic fraction separated 
by density gradient centrifugation. During surgery, 5 ml containing approximately 1.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(8) BMC were 
delivered by multiple injections in the ischemic myocardium. 
Before (B) and 6 months (6M) after the procedure, patient 
underwent clinical evaluation and myocardial perfusion 
assessment by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during pharmacological stress with dypiridamole. No major 
complications or deaths occurred during the procedure. One 
patient died after 2 years (non cardiac cause). There was a 
reduction in the ischemic score as assessed by MRI from 1.64
+/- 0.10 (B) to 0.88 +/- 0.09 (6M) (p = 0.01). Clinically, there was a reduction in functional class of angina from 3.7 +/- 0.2 
(B) to 1.3 +/- 0.2 (6M) (p < 0.0001). The authors concluded 
that in this initial experience,  the combined strategy of TMLR 
plus cell therapy appeared to be safe, and may have synergistically  acted to reduce myocardial ischemia, with 
clinically relevant improvement in functional capacity. 
Provided these data are confirmed in a larger, randomized, controlled trial with longer follow-up, this strategy could be 
used as a novel therapeutic 
option for treating patients with 
refractory angina. In this regard, Horvath (2008) stated that TMLR has been used as an adjunct to CABG. Combination 
CABG plus TMLR has resulted in symptomatic improvement without additional risk. Additional therapies to enhance the

3/18/2021 angiogenic response include combining TMLR with stem cell- 
based treatments, which appear to be promising future 
endeavors. 
Oesterle and colleagues (2000) reported their finding of 
percutaneous transmyocardial laser revascularization (PTMR), 
a catheter-based technique of TMLR, for refractory angina pectoris when bypass surgery or angioplasty is not possible. 
They concluded that PTMR was associated with increased 
exercise tolerance time, low morbidity, lower angina scores 
assessed by masked reviewers, and improved quality of life. 
Although there is controversy about the mechanism of action, and the contribution of the placebo effect can not be 
quantified, this unmasked study suggests that PTMR provides 
some clinical benefits in the defined population of patients. 
Commenting on the study by Oesterle et al (2000), Harbison 
and Kenny (2001) stated that PTMR is associated with a non- significant increase in mortality and a significant increase in 
non-anginal serious adverse events. 
Moreover, recent reports indicated that PTMR is ineffective in 
treating patients with refractory angina. Stone and associates 
(2001) reported that in a patient population at high risk for 
restenosis (n = 26), recently created PTMR channels are not 
protective against severe ischemia caused by acute vessel closure and that late symptomatic restenosis after 
percutaneous intervention (angioplasty) may still frequently 
occur despite PTMR in the same region. 
In a review on TMLR, Horvath (2002) noted that recent studies 
showed that PTMR failed to provide angina relief greater than 
that observed in placebo groups. In a prospective, multi-
center, randomized trial of PTMR in patients with class III or IV 
angina caused by non-recanalizable chronic total occlusions, Stone and colleagues (2002) reported that the performance of 
PTMR in addition to maximal medical therapy (n = 71) does

3/18/2021 not result in a greater reduction in angina, improvement in 
exercise duration or survival free of adverse cardiac events, as 
compared with maximal medical therapy only (n = 70). 
Gatterer et al (2004) evaluated the short-term as well as long- 
term results of PTMR for patients with therapy refractory 
angina pectoris who are not amenable for angioplasty or bypass surgery. The authors concluded that while the angina 
class of the patients improved significantly, there was no 
significant change of myocardial perfusion but a trend to 
deterioration of left ventricular function after an average follow- 
up period of 7.7 months. 
Leon et al (2005) reported the findings of a randomized, 
patient- and evaluator-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 
patients treated using PTMR. A total of 298 patients with 
severe angina were randomly assigned to receive low-dose or 
high-dose myocardial laser channels or no laser channels, 
blinded as a sham procedure. The primary end point was the 
change in exercise duration from baseline examination to 6 months. The incidence of 30-day death, stroke, myocardial 
infarction, coronary re-vascularization, or left ventricular 
perforation occurred in 2 patients in the placebo, 8 patients in 
the low-dose, and 4 patients in the high-dose groups (p = 
0.12); 30-day myocardial infarction incidence was higher in patients receiving either low-dose or high-dose laser (9 
patients) compared with placebo (no patients, p = 0.03). At 6 
months, there were no differences in the change in exercise 
duration between those receiving a sham (28.0 s, n = 100), 
low-dose laser (33.2 s, n = 98), or high-dose laser (28.0 s, n = 98, p = 0.94) procedure. There were also no differences in the 
proportion of patients improving to better than Canadian 
Cardiovascular Society class III angina symptoms at 6 
months. The follow-up visual summed stress single-photon- 
emission computed tomography scores were not significantly 
different from baseline in any group and were no different 
between groups. The modest improvement in angina symptoms assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire also

3/18/2021 was not statistically different among the arms. The authors 
concluded that treatment with PTMR provides no benefit 
beyond that of a similar sham procedure in patients blinded to their treatment status. 
An interventional procedure consultation document prepared 
for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2008) included the following provisional 
recommendations: "c]urrent evidence on percutaneous laser 
revascularisation (PLR) for refractory angina pectoris shows 
no efficacy and suggests that the procedure may pose 
unacceptable safety risks. Therefore, this procedure should not be used." An interventional procedure consultation 
document by NICE on laser transmyocardial revascularization 
reached similar conclusions. The assessments noted that 
these procedures have not been shown to reduce mortality, 
and reductions in pain and improvements in quality of life in unblinded studies are likely to be placebo effects. 
Guidelines from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (Bridges, et 
al., 2004) state that "transmyocardial laser revascularization 
may be an acceptable form of therapy for selected patients: as 
sole therapy for a subset of patients with refractory angina and as an adjunct to coronary artery bypass graft surgery for a 
subset of patients with angina who cannot be completely 
revascularized surgically." 
In a meta-analysis, McGillion et al (2010) evaluated the 
effectiveness of PMLR versus optimal medical therapy for 
improving angina symptoms, health-related quality of life 
(HRQL), and exercise performance; the impact on all-cause 
mortality was also examined. A total of 7 trials (n = 1,213) were included. Primary analyses showed that at 12- 
month follow-up, those who had received PMLR had greater 
than or equal to 2 Canadian Cardiovascular Society class 
angina symptom reductions, odds ratio (OR) 2.13 (95 % 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.22 to 3.73), as well as improvements in aspects of HRQL including angina frequency, SMD = 0.29

3/18/2021 (95 % CI: 0.05 to 0.52), disease perception, SMD = 0.37 (95 % 
CI: 0.14 to 0.61), and physical limitations, SMD = 0.29 (95 % CI: 0.05 to 0.53). Percutaneous transmyocardial laser 
revascularization had no significant impact on all-cause  
mortality. For secondary analyses, in which these  
researchers considered data from 1 trial that featured a higher- 
dose laser group, yielded no  significant  overall impact of 
PMLR across outcomes. The authors concluded that while 
PMLR may be effective for improving angina symptoms and 
related burden, further work is needed to clarify appropriate 
dose and impact on disease-specific mortality and adverse 
cardiac events.  
Excimer laser coronary angioplasty (ELCA) is one of the methods that fall within the spectrum of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) techniques. Coronary laser 
angioplasty is an alternative to coronary artery bypass surgery 
but not a replacement therapy for those patients considered 
unfit for surgery. In the majority of laser angioplasty cases, 
balloon angioplasty will also be required during the same 
procedure to achieve satisfactory results. Although the Spectranectics ELCA system is approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for moderately calcified lesions, 
studies indicated an increased complication rate and lower 
success rate for these lesions. Thus, available evidence does 
not support laser technology as the most appropriate intervention. 
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association (ACC/AHA) 2005 guideline update for PCI (Smith 
et al, 2006) does not include ELCA in treatment 
recommendations. In a discussion of techniques associated with PCI, the authors stated that despite the improvement in 
acute results observed for rotational atherectomy and excimer 
laser, there is no evidence that these approaches improve 
long-term outcomes in lesions that can be safely treated with 
https://aetnet.aetna.com/mpa /cpb/100_199/0163.html

3/18/2021 balloon angioplasty or stenting alone. Furthermore, ELCA is 
not mentioned in a 2007 focused update of the 2005 
guidelines (King et al, 2008). 
An assessment of ELCA by the Ludwig Boltzmann Institut 
(Johanssen, et al., 2010) found that the laser angioplasty has 
been reported as a debulking tool in highly calcified stenosis and in chronic total occlusions followed by a conventional 
balloon angioplasty/stenting. This systematic review included 
one randomized controlled trial with per randomization and per 
protocol analysis, and two case series without 
controls, reporting on a total of 444 patients. The assessment concluded that, due to limitations in the design of these 
studies, the evidence of effectiveness and safety is low. The 
report recommend against reimbursement for ELCA 
in Austrian hospitals. 
Excimer laser coronary angioplasty has also been studied as a 
treatment for patients with acute myocardial infarction, and in 
patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. 
However, there is currently insufficient evidence to 
demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of ELCA for these 
indications. 
Niccoli et al (2013) stated that laser atherectomy might 
decrease procedural complications during PCI of degenerated saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) in case of unstable or 
thrombotic lesions because of its ability to de-bulk and 
vaporize thrombus. These investigators prospectively 
evaluated the safety and effectiveness of ELCA as a primary 
treatment strategy in consecutively unstable patients undergoing PCI of degenerated SVG lesions. A total of 71 
consecutive patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary 
syndrome (mean age of 69 ± 10 years, 66 men [89 %]) 
undergoing PCI of degenerated SVG were enrolled in a 
prospective case-control registry, using 2 different distal protection devices (DPDs; FilterWire EZ [Boston Scientific, 
Natick, MA; n = 24] and SpiderRX [Ev3, Plymouth, MN; n =

3/18/2021 23]) or ELCA (n = 24) were included in this study. Primary 
end-points of the study were incidence of angiographic 
microvascular obstruction (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade of less than 3 or Thrombolysis In 
Myocardial Infraction flow grade of 3 with myocardial blush 
grade 1 to 2) and incidence of type IVa myocardial infarction. 
Angiographic microvascular obstruction incidence tended to be 
less in ELCA-treated patients compared with DPD-treated patients (3 [13 %] versus 15 [32 %], p = 0.09). Type IVa 
myocardial infarction incidence was more in DPD-treated 
patients compared with ELCA-treated patients (23 [49 %] 
versus 5 [21 %], p = 0.04). The authors concluded that in 
patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome 
undergoing PCI of degenerated SVG, ELCA compared with 
DPD, is associated with a trend for better myocardial reperfusion and a lesser incidence of peri-procedural 
necrosis. Moreover, they stated that controlled randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to confirm these early 
observations. 
Fracassi et al (2013) noted that excimer laser utilization as an 
adjunctive device for PCI has increased in the last few years. 
Technical advancements have led to better results in terms of 
safety and effectiveness with a low complication rate. In 
particular, excimer laser for thrombus-containing lesions is 
able to achieve rapid thrombus removal and plaque de-bulking 
along with subsequent facilitation of stent angioplasty and a low rate of microvascular obstruction. Other indications for 
laser angioplasty embrace in-stent restenosis, chronic total 
occlusions, SVG lesions and new potential applications, such 
as stent expansion optimization and bi-furcation lesions. The 
authors concluded that as for other medical devices, however, excimer laser should be tested in future RCTs against current 
standard of therapy in order to better define its role for each of 
the indications summarized above.

3/18/2021 Lam and colleagues (2014) reported the successful 
management of under-expansion of a newly deployed 
coronary stent refractory to balloon dilatations. Direct stenting was performed for a lesion in the mid left anterior descending 
artery (without angiographically apparent heavy coronary 
calcification). The stent remained under-expanded despite 
repeated balloon dilatations including with high-pressure 
inflations. Subsequently, an excimer laser catheter was used in an attempt to vaporize the plaque by the accousto- 
mechanical effect of the rapidly exploding bubbles. The 
overall angiographic result was good after further balloon 
dilatation with ordinary pressure and full stent expansion was 
achieved. The authors concluded that management of under- 
expansion of a newly deployed stent is a potential indication of 
laser angioplasty. 
Excimer Laser for Coronary Artery Restenosis In-Stent 
Treatment 
Hirose and associates (2016) stated that treatment of in-stent 
restenosis (ISR) is associated with a high incidence of 
recurrence. These investigators evaluated the clinical safety 
and 6-month efficacy of ELCA before scoring balloon dilatation for the treatment of ISR. A total of 23 patients with ISR were 
included and treatment strategy of ISR was dependent on 
each operator; 12 patients among those were treated with 
ELCA before scoring balloon dilatation (ELCA group); and 11 
patients were treated with scoring balloon alone (non-ELCA 
group). Acute procedural results were evaluated by 
quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and frequency domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT). Follow-up 
angiography was performed in all patients and the incidence of 
recurrent ISR and target lesion revascularization (TLR) was 
determined at 6 months after initial ISR treatment. Procedural 
success was achieved in all patients. Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were similar between groups. 
Maximum dilatation pressure of scoring balloon was 
significantly lower in the ELCA group than in the non-ELCA

3/18/2021 group (9.0 ± 3.1 versus 14.9 ± 4.3 ATM, p = 0.001). In follow- 
up angiography, the occurrence of TLR was similar between 
groups (16.7 versus 45.5 %, p = 0.09), but the late luminal loss 
was significantly lower in the ELCA group (0.7 ± 0.6 versus 1.3 
± 0.7 mm, p = 0.03). The authors concluded that ELCA was a 
safe and feasible technique for the treatment of ISR and 
associated with a relatively low recurrent restenosis in 
comparison with scoring balloon dilatation alone. The long- term effectiveness of this approach need to be established by 
well-designed studies. 
Ambrosini and colleagues (2017) noted that stents reduce 
angiographic restenosis in comparison with balloon 
angioplasty. The rate of ISR, although less frequent than post- 
angioplasty restenosis, is becoming increasingly prevalent due 
to the recent exponential increase in the use of intracoronary 
stents. In a multi-centric, case-control study, these 
researchers evaluated angiographic and clinical outcomes of 
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in combination with the use of ELCA and drug-eluting balloon 
(DEB) in treatment of patients with ISR (n = 80). All patients 
underwent 9 months of clinical and a coronary angiography 
follow-up. This study showed clinical and angiographic long- 
term success in the 91 % of the patients. The incidence of myocardial infarctions (MI) and deaths was lower than the rate 
after plain balloon angioplasty within the stent. The authors 
concluded that the findings of this study showed that ELCA 
and DEB may be an alternative treatment for ISR. 
Lee and colleagues (2019) evaluated the effectiveness of 
ELCA to treat ISR due to peri-stent calcium-related stent 
under-expansion as assessed by OCT. These investigators 
studied 81 patients (81 lesions with ISR, stent under- 
expansion, and peri-stent calcium greater than 90°) who underwent OCT imaging both pre- and post-PCI and 
compared lesions treated with ELCA (n = 23) vs without ELCA 
(n = 58). The use of ELCA was associated with more calcium 
fracture (ELCA: 61 %, non-ELCA: 12 %, p < 0.01), larger final 
https://aetnet.aetna.com/mpa /cpb/100_199/0163.html

3/18/2021 minimum lumen area (ELCA: 4.76 mm2 [3.25, 5.57], non- 
ELCA: 3.46 mm2 [2.80, 4.13], p < 0.01), and a larger previously implanted stent area (ELCA: 6.15 mm2 [4.83, 7.09], 
non-ELCA: 4.65 mm2 [3.84, 5.40], p < 0.01). In the multi- variable model, ELCA use was associated with peri-stent 
calcium fracture (OR 46.5; 95 % CI: 6.8 to 315.9, p = 0.01) 
that, in turn, was associated with final larger lumen and stent 
dimensions. Finally, contrast injection during ELCA was 
associated with multiple calcium fractures and fractures even 
in thicker calcium. The authors concluded that ELCA was effective for treating ISR with under-expansion by disrupting 
peri-stent calcium, facilitating better expansion of the 
previously implanted stent. The drawbacks of this study 
included that this was a retrospective observation study, and 
the number of patients was relatively small (n = 23 for ELCA treated subjects) precluding sub-group analysis especially the 
number of lesion treated with ELCA, likely causing selection 
bias. 
Ichimoto and co-workers (2018) noted that ELCA has been 
used for the treatment of complex PCI such as ISR. However, 
little information was provid
ed about the clinical outcomes after 
treatment with ELCA for ISR of drug-eluting stents (DES). 
These investigators examined the long-term clinical outcomes 
after PCI with ELCA for ISR of DES.  A total of 81 consecutive 
patients with 87 lesions who underwent PCI for ISR of DES were included. Patients were classified into  a PCI with ELCA 
group (23 patients with 24 lesions) and a PCI without ELCA group (58 patients with 63 lesions). The major adverse 
cardiac events (MACE) were evaluated. The mean duration of clinical follow-up was 29.8 ± 11.6 months. The incidences of 
diffuse restenosis and AHA/ACC type B2 or C lesion in the PCI  
with ELCA group were higher than in the PCI without ELCA group. Quantitative coronary angiography showed the acute 
luminal gain in the PCI with ELCA group was greater than in the PCI without ELCA group (1.64 ± 0.48 mm versus 1.26 ± 
0.42 mm, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in 
all-cause death, MI, or TLR between the 2 groups. Multi-

3/18/2021 variate analysis due to a Cox proportional-hazards model 
showed that multi-vessel disease was an independent 
predictor of MACE (hazard ratio [HR] 3.05, 95 % CI: 1.22 to 7.61, p = 0.02). The authors concluded that ELCA was 
effective as an atherectomy device for lumen enlargement and 
optimal lesion preparation. These researchers noted that even 
though ELCA was used for ISR of DES in significantly more 
complex lesions, the long-term clinical outcomes were favorable and similar. 
In an editorial that accompanied the afore-mention study by 
Ichimoto et al (2018), Nakamura and associates (2018) stated that “Their findings suggest that ELCA is safe and effective at 
facilitating balloon or stent expansion by ablating in-stent 
intimal hyperplasia and improving optimal lesion preparation, 
especially in un-dilatable and under-expanded stents, although 
their study has several potential limitations, such as the absence of randomization to the treatment strategy, the small 
number of intravascular imaging used, and the retrospective 
nature of the study. We look forward to further studies in a 
larger number of patients and randomized trials”. 
Hashimoto and associates (2019) examined the impact of 
tissue characterization for ISR with OCT during ELCA in the 
DES era. The effect of ELCA for ISR according to differences 
in tissue characteristics is unclear. A total of 53 ISR lesions (7 bare metal stents [BMS] and 46 DES) were treated with an 
ELCA catheter. After ELCA, balloon dilatation with either the 
scoring or non-compliant balloons was conducted. The 
procedure was completed by applying a drug-coated balloon. 
Tissue characterization and lumen measurement with OCT 
were performed 3 times: before PCI, after ELCA, and after the 
procedure. Lesions were categorized into the homogenous, layered, and mixed groups. Follow-up angiograms were 
conducted 6 to 12 months following PCI. No significant 
differences in MLA were observed before PCI. A significant 
difference was observed in MLA following ELCA among the 3 
groups (homogeneous group: 1.75 ± 0.84 mm2, layered group:

3/18/2021 1.72  ±  0.45 mm2, mixed group: 2.24  ±  0.70 mm2, p  =  0.048). 
Final MLA was larger in the mixed group than in the 
homogeneous group (p =  0.028). No significant difference was 
observed in binary re-stenosis in the follow-up angiogram 
(homogeneous group 55.5 %, layered group 33.3 %, mixed 
group 33.3 %; p  =  0.311) and the TLR rate (homogeneous 30.0  
%, layered 23.8 %, mixed 25.0 %; p =  0.923). The authors 
concluded that  tissue characterization by OCT may predict the 
efficacy of ELCA and balloon  angioplasty for ISR during the 
acute phase. These researchers stated that despite these differences observed in the acute phase, no clinical difference 
in the chronic phase was observed; further studies with a 
larger sample size are needed. 
The authors stated that this study had several drawbacks. 
First, this was an observational, retrospective, single-center 
study. Only 53 lesions with 3 cohorts were evaluated. Thus, 
the study’s ability to detect significant correlates of effects with 
ELCA and OCT finding was limited. Second, there was no 
control group to evaluate the additional effect of ELCA in ISR 
treatment. Third, other potential confounders that could affect the result, such as the difference of the diseased stent (BMS 
or DES, the generation of DES, stent size, stent length), 
balloon size, and differences in the position of the coronary 
stent, were not evaluated. In fact, the homogenous group 
utilized a significantly smaller balloon size and stent used in the index procedure. Fourth, the risk factors contributing to 
ISR and TLR, such as the presence of antiplatelet therapy, 
ACS presentation, older age, diabetes mellitus, and multiple 
TLR, were not fully evaluated. In addition, these investigators 
stated that ELCA is designed to ablate the obstructive atherosclerotic plaque rather than creating deformation of the 
plaque as in balloon dilatation. This design is considered as a 
more rational therapeutic option for debulking before 
adjunctive balloon dilatation, in contrast to balloon dilatation 
alone for stent re-stenosis, as it is superior in dilating the 
lumen and stent areas. In fact, ELCA with an IVUS-based 
study for ISR in BMS was documented to be effective in the

 Transmyocardial an d Endovascula r Lase r Revascularization - Medical Cl inical Policy ... Page 16 of 33 
3/18/2021 ablation of neointimal tissue in BMS. However, acute 
procedural results as well as long-term angiographic and 
clinical results of ELCA with balloon dilatation were not superior to balloon dilatation alone. Accordingly, ELCA was 
abandoned as a strategy for treating ISR. Moreover, 
according to the recent guidelines on myocardial re- 
vascularization, i.e., European Society of Cardiology 
Guideline, ELCA was not cited as useful for the treatment of ISR. 
Furthermore, an UpToDate review on “Specialized 
revascularization devices in the management of coronary heart disease” (Cutlip, 2019) states that “The American 
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for 
Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions 
(ACC/AHA/SCAI) guideline update concluded that there is no 
evidence that excimer laser coronary angiography (ELCA) improves late outcomes in lesions that can be safely treated 
with stenting or angioplasty alone”. 
Transmyocardial Laser Revascularization Plus Cell 
Therapy 
Konstanty-Kalandyk (2018) noted that refractory angina has 
limited effective therapeutic options and often contributes to 
frequent hospitalizations, morbidity and impaired quality of life (QOL). These researchers examined mid-term results of a bio­
interventional therapy combining TMLR and intra- myocardial 
injection of adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) in patients with 
refractory angina not amenable to percutaneous or surgical 
revascularization. This study included 15 patients with severe refractory angina and anterior wall ischemia who 
were ineligible for re-vascularization strategies. Adipose tissue 
was harvested and purified, giving the stem cell concentrate. 
All patients underwent left anterior thoracotomy and TMLR 
using a low-powered holmium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser 
and intra-myocardial injection of ADSC using a combined 
delivery system. No deaths or major adverse cardiovascular

3/18/2021 or cerebrovascular events were observed in the 6-month 
follow-up. Mean ejection fraction increased from 35 % to 38 
%, and mean Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Score decreased from 3.2 to 1.4, with decreased necessity of nitrate 
usage; 73 % of patients reported health improvement 
particularly regarding general health and bodily pain. 
Improvement in endocardial movement, myocardial thickening 
and stroke volume index (35.26 to 46.23 ml/m2) on cardiac MRI was observed in 3 patients who had repeat CMR imaging 
after 6 months. The authors concluded that the findings of this 
study suggested that interventional therapy combining TMLR 
with intra-myocardial implantation of ADSC may reduce 
symptoms and improve QOL in patients with refractory 
angina. Moreover, they stated that these early findings need 
further validation in large, multi-center RCTs. 
The authors stated that the main drawbacks of this study were 
the small sample size (n = 15) and lack of a control group, 
which limited the statistical rigor of the findings and questioned 
the efficacy results. However, the improvement in symptoms 
was accompanied by an improvement in myocardial function. 
Despite these drawbacks, this study provided an important 
opportunity to explore a new therapeutic option that has a great potential to improve the QOL. 
Bockeria and colleagues (2019) examined the long-term 
results of TMLR using a CO2 laser in combination with intra- 
myocardial injection of autologous bone marrow stem cells 
(ABMSC) as an isolated procedure in patients with the end- 
stage coronary artery disease. This trial included 20 patients (90 % men), with a mean age of 58.4 ± 8.7 years. To assess 
the long-term results, patients were examined in a hospital. 
The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire 
(MLHFQ) and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) were 
used. The evolution of laboratory and instrumental indices, as 
well as medical therapy, was assessed. The end-points of the 
study were death, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), repeated myocardial re-vascularization, recurrent hospitalizations due to

3/18/2021 coronary artery disease (CAD), and stroke. The changes in 
angina functional class (FC) were also evaluated. The median 
of follow-up period was 54 (36 to 83) months. The analysis of the evolution of echocardiographic data showed the absence 
of statistically significant changes in the following parameters: 
left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (EDD) (p = 0.967), end- 
systolic diameter (ESD) (p = 0.204), end-diastolic volume 
(EDV) (p = 0.852), end-systolic volume (ESV) (p = 0.125), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p = 0.120). Patients 
continued to regularly take the main groups of medications. 
Nitrate consumption was significantly reduced (p < 0.001). 
Significant po  sitive dynamics were observed in the changes in 
angina FC. At the baseline,  all patients had angina III FC, in 
the long-term, 3 patients had II FC, 11 patients had I FC, and 6 
patients had no angina. Clinical outcomes (mortality, recurrent MI, stroke) were absent during the follow-up period. There 
were 2 cases of repeated myocardial re-vascularization.  
Regression analysis revealed that SYNTAX score was 
associated with the clinical outcome "repeated re- 
vascularization". The authors concluded that TMLR in combination with intra-myocardial injection of ABMSC was a 
safe method to achieve a statistically significant anti-anginal 
effect and reduce the need for "nitrates", which in turn 
improved the QOL and reduced the frequency of 
hospitalizations due to CAD. The researchers stated that these results could be achieved with strict adherence to the 
certain indications for the intervention. The main drawbacks of 
this study were its small sample size (n = 20) and the lack of a 
control, which limited the statistical rigor of the findings. These 
findings need to be validated by well-designed studies. 
Excimer Laser for Acute Coronary Syndrome 
Harima and colleagues (2018) tested a novel stent-less re- 
vascularization strategy using a combination of ELCA and 
drug-coated balloon (DCB) for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Consecutive ACS patients were planned to 
receive either a DCB application following ELCA without a

3/18/2021 stent implantation or conventional re-vascularization with a 
coronary stent. The end-points were MACEs, defined as the 
composite of cardiac death, MIs, and TLR; target vessel revascularization (TVR); and angiographic outcome. Since a 
greater than expected number of patients allocated to the stent­
less treatment arm eventually received a bailout stenting, the 
following 3 as-treated groups were compared; DCB with 
ELCA group (n = 60), stent with ELCA group (n = 23), and stent 
without ELCA group (n = 85). During a mean follow-up period 
of 420 ± 137 days, and with angiographic 6- and 12-month- 
follow-up rates of 96.7 %, 87 %, and 81.2 %, and 50 %, 65.2 
%, and 45.9 %, respectively, the MACE rate did not differ 
across the groups (10 %, 4.3 %, and 3.5 %; p = 0.22) while an 
incidence of TVR was more common (15 %, 0, and 4.7 %; p = 0.02) 
and the diameter stenosis at 6-months of follow-up was greater (25.7 ± 18.2, 14.9 ± 13.1 and 16.2 ± 15.4 %; p = 0.002) 
in the DCB with ELCA group. The authors concluded that the stent-less re-vascularization strategy with DCB and ELCA was 
associated with a higher occurrence of re-stenosis in ACS 
patients.
