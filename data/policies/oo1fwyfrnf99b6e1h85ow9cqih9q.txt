Background/Overview  
Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disorder affecting the lungs and other organs that ultimately leads 
to an early death. It is caused by mutations in a gene that encodes for a protein called CFTR that 
regulates ion (such as chloride) and water transport in the body. The defect in chloride and water 
transport results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract and other 
parts of the body leading to severe respiratory and digestive problems, as well as other complications 
such as infections and diabetes.  
 
Symdeko is a combination of the CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor, and tezacaftor which increases the 
amount of mature CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface. The combined effect of these two 
drugs is to increase the quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface which results in increased 
chloride transport. Symdeko is indicated for treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients 6  years of age 
and older who are either homozygous for the F508del  mutation in the CFTR  gene (the most common 
CFTR  genotype and associated with severe disease) or who have at least one mutation in the CFTR  
gene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Symdeko) based on clinical and/or in vitro  assay data. 
If a patient’s mutation status is not k nown, an FDA-cleared cystic fibrosis mutation test should be 
used to determine whether a CFTR  mutation is present. Symdeko is supplied as co-packaged 
tezacaftor 100mg/ivacaftor 150 mg fixed-dose combination tablets with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets and 
tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg tablets with ivacaftor 75 mg tablets. Patients should take one 
combination tablet in the morning and one ivacaftor tablet in the evening. Both doses should be 
taken with a fat-containing meal to ensure adequate absorption. Examples of foods that contain fat 
are those prepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs, cheeses, nuts, whole milk, or meats.

Symdeko is not indicated for use in combination with other targeted cystic fibrosis therapies 
including Kalydeco, Orkambi, and Trikafta. It should be noted that all of these products contain 
ivacaftor as one of the active ingredients and Trikafta and Symdeko both contain tezacaftor as 
another active ingredient.   
 
FDA or Other Governmental Regulatory Approval  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Symdeko was approved by the FDA in February 2018 for the treatment of patients with cystic 
fibrosis aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del  mutation or who have at least 
one mutation in the CFTR  gene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro data and/or 
clinical evidence. In June 2019, the label was updated to include patients 6 years of age and older . 
In December 2020, the label was further expanded to include 127  additional mutations based on in 
vitro  data.   
 
Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer-reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines. 
 
The efficacy of Symdeko was evaluated in two trials in different patient populations. The EVOLVE 
trial evaluated 510 patients 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del  mutation in 
the CFTR  gene. These subjects were randomized to placebo or Symdeko for 24 weeks. Treatment 
with Symdeko resulted in modest improvement in FEV 1 (absolute change, 4 percentage points versus 
placebo), and modest improvement in disease-related quality of life score (5.1 points versus 
placebo). The rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 35% lower in the treatment group compared with 
placebo (HR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.46-0.88). BMI increased slightly during the 24 week study, but was 
not significantly different between the study groups. 
 
The EXPAND trial evaluated 248 patients 12 years and older who were heterozygous for the 
F508del mutation and had a residual function mutation and mild or moderate cystic fibrosis-related 
lung disease. The patients were randomized in a crossover study to Symdeko alone, ivacaftor

(Kalydeco) monotherapy, or placebo. Treatment with Symdeko resulted in modest improvement in 
FEV 1 (absolute change, 6.8 percentage points versus placebo), as did ivacaftor monotherapy 
(absolute change, 4.7 percentage points versus placebo). The benefit of Symdeko compared to 
Kalydeco was slight, but statistically significant (absolute change, 2.1 percentage points). Symdeko 
also resulted in clinically significant improvements in a disease-related quality of life score (11.1 
points versus placebo).  
 
The efficacy of Symdeko in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years was extrapolated form patients age 
12 years and older with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing similar 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor exposure levels in patients age 6 to less than 12 years and in patients age 12 
years and older. Safety of Symdeko in this population was derived from a 240 week, open-label, 
clinical trial in 70 patients age 6 to less than 12 years administered either tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 
75 mg and ivacaftor 75 mg or tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg and ivacaftor 150 mg, 12 hours 
apart. Th safety profile for patients in this trial was similar to that observed in Trials 1 and 3.

*Investigational – A medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product is 
Investigational if the effectiveness has not been clearly tested and it has not been incorporated into 
standard medical practice. Any determination we make that a medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is Investigational will be based on a consideration of the following: 
A. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product can be 
lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
whether such approval has been granted at the time the medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is sought to be furnished; or 
B. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product requires 
further studies or clinical trials to determine its maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, safety, 
effectiveness, or effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or 
diagnosis, must improve health outcomes, according to the consensus of opinion among 
experts as shown by reliable evidence, including: 
1. Consultation with technology evaluation center(s); 
2. Credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community; or 
3. Reference to federal regulations.
