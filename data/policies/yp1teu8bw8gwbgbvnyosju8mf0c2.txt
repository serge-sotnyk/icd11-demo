Exception : Aetna will cover autologous hematopoietic cell 
transplantation, tandem hematopoietic cell transplantation, or allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation for breast cancer when it is performed 
in a clinical trial sponsored or authorized by the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) or the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Four 
randomized controlled clinical trials showed that autologous 
hematopoietic cell transplantation was either similar to or m ore harmful 
than standard -dose chemotherapy. Doubts have risen concerning

BACKGROUND  
Appropriate treatment for breast cancer depends on the stage of the 
cancer, the patient's overall health, and other patient characteristics, such 
as estrogen receptor status, age, and menopausal status. Treatment may include surgery, radiation, standard- dose chemotherapy, hormonal 
therapy, or a combination of these. Despite a lack of research showing that high- dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell support 
(AuSCS) is effective in increasing survival, this approach has become an 
increasingly common treatment strategy for women with breast cancer. 
High- dose chemotherapy/AuSCS is based on the concept that some of 
the chemotherapeutic drugs used in standard -dose chemotherapy might 
kill more cancer cells if given at much higher doses. However, high doses 
are very toxic to the bone marrow, and techniques had to be developed to 
restore a patient's ability to make blood cells after HDC by infusing stem 
cells harvested prior to treatment from either the patient's bone marrow 
(ABMT) or peripheral blood (PBSCT). Collectively, these techniques are 
known as AuSCS. The HDC/AuSCS procedure was initially used as a 
treatment for metastatic disease; however, its use has expanded to women with very high -risk primary breast cancer that has spread to 
multiple lymph nodes, but is not yet widely metastatic.

Early published results of small uncontrolled phase I and II trials and large 
retrospective studies of women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) 
suggested the potential for higher response rates and increased survival 
with HDC. However, the results from these early uncontrolled studies were contradicted by several subsequently published randomized 
controlled clinical trials. In April 1999, the American Society of Clinical 
Oncologists (ASCO) released preliminary results of 4 randomized 
controlled phase III trials. Two of the studies examined the use of 
HDC/AuSCS in the adjuvant treatment of women with very high- risk 
primary breast cancer defined as cancer that has spread to at least 10 
lymph nodes. Two studies ex amined the use of HDC/AuSCS for the 
treatment of advanced, MBC. The early data from these multi -center 
studies indicated that, at the present time, there is no difference in overall 
survival (OS) between HDC/AuSCS and standard, lower doses of 
chemotherapy. 
The only controlled clinical trial showing higher response rates for 
HDC/AuSCS than standard -dose chemotherapy was a study first 
published in 1995 by Bezwoda and his colleagues from the University of 
Witwatersrand, South Africa. This study involved 90 patients with MBC who were randomized to receive either HDC/AuSCS or a lower dose 
regimen of chemotherapy not requiring ABMT. The researchers found a 
significantly higher overall response rate for patients who received 
HDC/AuSCS (95 %) compared with standard -dose chemotherapy (53 %). 
Upon further analysis, many experts in the field have agreed that this study of small size (45 in the HDC/AuSCS group and 45 in the standard) 
was poorly designed, contained major flaws in scientific research, and 
that its results are insufficient to prove the superiority of HDC/AuSCS. The standard -dose chemotherapy regimen used in the Bezwoda study is 
not commonly used. While the results of the HDC/AuSCS group are better than the results of standard- dose regimens in most published 
studies, the median survival times of groups of patients from several published studies of standard -dose regimens are about the same or 
better than the median survival times of HDC/AuSCS patients in the Bezwoda study. The 45 -week median survival seen in patients in the 
standard- dose group was shorter than the 68-week median survival seen 
in previously reported standard- dose groups. The length of time the 
response lasted in the Bezwoda study standard -dose group (34 weeks) 
was also shorter than that seen in standard -dose studies (41 weeks).

addition, the follow -up time in the Bezwoda study was short. Half of the 
patients were in the study for less than 1½ years (72 weeks); the others 
were in the study for at most 2½ years. 
Given the preliminary nature of the data, the conflicting initial results, and 
the specific differences in the study designs, it is not yet possible to draw 
definitive conclusions about the role of HDC/AuSCS in breast cancer. In 
order to safeguard the public from false claims, inaccuracies, and 
premature conclusions, initial results such as these often require 
additional years of follow -up to see if the results are sustained, and must 
also be verified by other investigators to ensure that there were no flaws 
or biases in the methodology. Despite public sentiment for treatment availability, there is insufficient outcomes data available from controlled 
clinical trials published in peer- reviewed literature to draw firm 
conclusions regarding the superiority of HDC/AuSCS over standard- dose 
chemotherapy in treating breast cancer. 
A systematic evidence review prepared for the Cochrane Collaboration 
(Farquhar et al, 2005a) stated that there is insufficient evidence to 
support the routine use of HDC with autograft for women with early poor 
prognosis breast cancer. Furthermore, Farquhar et al (2005b) stated that 
although there is evidence that HDC and autograft improves event -free 
survival (EFS) compared to conventional chemotherapy, there is no 
evidence of benefit in OS for women with MBC. The authors concluded that "[h]igh dose chemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell 
transplantation should not be given to women with metastatic breast 
cancer outside of clinical trials." 
Pedrazzoli and associates (2003) evaluated autologous hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation for breast cancer using data from the European 
Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry from 1990 to 1999. 
The authors stated that continued investigation HDC with autologous 
stem cell transplantation is still needed. 
In a randomized controlled trial (n = 885), Rodenhuis et al (2003) reported 
that HDC with autologous peripheral -blood hematopoietic progenitor -cell 
transplantation improved relapse -free survival among patients with stage 
II or III breast cancer and 10 or more positive axillary lymph nodes. This 
benefit may be confined to patients with HER -2/neu -negative tumors. On

the other hand, Tallman et al (2003), in a randomized controlled study (n 
= 511), concluded that the addition of HDC and autologous hematopoietic 
stem -cell transplantation to 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with 
cyclophosphamide (CY), doxorubicin, and fluorouracil might reduce the 
risk of relapse but did not improve the outcome among patients with 
primary breast cancer and at least 10 involved axillary lymph nodes. The 
authors stated that conventional -dose adjuvant chemotherapy remains 
the standard of care for such patients. 
Zander et al (2004) compared the effects of HDC followed by autologous 
hematopoietic stem -cell support with standard -dose chemotherapy (SD ­
CT) as adjuvant treatment in patients with primary breast cancer and 10 or more positive axillary lymph nodes (n = 307). These researchers 
concluded that there was a trend in favor of HDC with respect to EFS, but 
without statistical significance. Further investigation is needed to 
ascertain the effect of HDC as compared with SD -CT as adjuvant 
treatment in high- risk primary breast cancer. In a multi -center 
randomized controlled study (n = 785), Peters et al (2005) found that 
high-dose cyclophosphamide (CY), cisplatin, and carmustine with stem -
cell support was not superior to intermediate -dose CY, cisplatin, and 
carmustine with G -CSF support but without stem cells for EFS or OS 
among all randomized women with high- risk primary breast cancer. This 
in agreement with the findings of Leonard et al (2004) who found that autograft -supported, HDC is not superior to conventional chemotherapy in 
patients with breast cancer who have multiple involved lymph nodes. 
In a 12-year follow -up study on the use of HDC/AuSCS for patients with 
high-risk primary breast carcinoma (n = 78), Hanrahan et al (2006) 
reported that there is no recurrence- free survival or OS advantage for 
these patients treated with HDC/AuSCS after standard dose chemotherapy with 5 -fluorouracil, doxorubicin and CY. These authors 
stated that there remains no conclusive evidence to support a role of 
HDC/AuSCS in patients with high- risk primary breast cancer, and it 
continues to be an investigational technology. 
Furthermore, Schmid et al (2005) compared up -front tandem HDC and 
standard combination therapy in patients with MBC (n = 93). Patients 
without prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomly 
assigned to standard combination therapy with doxorubicin and paclitaxel

(AT) or double HDC with CY, mito xantrone, and etoposide followed by 
peripheral -blood stem -cell transplantation. High- dose chemotherapy was 
repeated after 6 weeks. Patients were stratified by menopausal and 
hormone- receptor status. The primary objective was to compare 
complete response (CR) rates. This trial failed to show a benefit for up ­
front tandem HDC compared with standard combination therapy. Also, 
HDC was associated with more acute adverse effects. 
Bishop (2004) noted that the prognosis is poor and the options are limited 
for patients with MBC, particularly for those who had been treated with 
taxanes and anthracyclines. Murine models have shown that allogeneic 
T cells are capable of eliciting graft -versus -tumor (GVT) effects against 
breast cancer, inhibiting growth of breast cancer cell lines in vivo, providing the rationale to pursue allogeneic adoptive cellular therapy as a 
strategy to treat MBC. However, the clinical application of allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) was limited by 
concerns over toxi city and unproven effectiveness. The development of 
non-myeloablative conditioning regimens (i.e., reduced intensity 
conditioning (RIC) transplant or mini -allograft), which have less treatment-
related mortality but preserve the T -cell mediated GVT effects , led to 
increased investigation of alloHSCT in MBC. Early reports of non ­
myeloablative alloHSCT indicate that a clinical GVT effect against breast 
cancer does exist. The responses, observed in 20 to 40 % of patients, appear to be associated with the deve lopment of complete donor 
lymphoid chimerism and may be delayed. In its current form, alloHSCT by itself is unlikely to result in complete eradication of MBC; however, it 
may serve as a therapeutic platform to complement and enhance the effects of existing cytotoxic therapies and immunotherapies (e.g., 
trastuzumab), as well as therapies under development (e.g., vaccines). 
Current data on alloHSCT for MBC should be interpreted cautiously and 
carefully used for the design of future studies to fully ascertain the clinical 
effectiveness of this form of adoptive cellular therapy in MBC. 
Baron and Sandmaier (2005) stated that recent retrospective studies comparing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after myeloablative or 
non-myeloablative regimens suggested that the use of non -myeloablative 
conditioning might be associated with lower transplant -related toxicity, 
lower non- relapse mortality, and at least similar intermediate -term 
progression- free survival (PFS). These investigators concluded that

hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following non -myeloablative 
conditioning might become the procedure of choice also for younger 
patients. Phase III clinical trials are needed to determine outcomes for 
different diseases and age groups. 
In a phase III clinical  trial,  the Southwest  Oncology Group  
(SWOG)/Intergroup study 9623 (Moore et al, 2007)  compared  treatment  
with  an  anthracycline- based  adjuvant  chemotherapy  regimen  followed  by 
HDC  with  autologous  hematopoietic  progenitor  cell  support  (AHPCS)  with 
a modern dose- dense dose- escalated (non- standard)  regimen including 
both an anthracycline and a taxane.  Patients in this  study  had operable 
breast  cancer involving 4 or more axillary lymph nodes  and had 
completed mastectomy  or breast -conserving surgery. They were 
randomly  assigned  to  receive  sequential  dose -dense  and  dose- escalated 
chemotherapy  with  doxorubicin,  paclitaxel,  and  CY  (group  1),  or  4  cycles 
of doxorubicin and CY followed by  HDC  with AHPCS (group 2).  The  
primary end point of  this study was  disease- free survival (DFS). Among 
536 eligible patients, there was no significant  difference between the 2 
arms  for  DFS or  OS.  Estimated  5-year  DFS  was  80  %  (95  %  confidence 
interval [CI]:  76 % to 85 %) for dose- dense therapy and  75 %  (95 % CI: 
69  %  to  80  %)  for  transplantation.  Estimated  5-year  OS  was  88  %  (95  % 
CI:  84  %  to  92  %)  for  dose- dense  therapy  and  84  %  (95  %  CI:  79  %  to  88  
%)  for  transplantation.  The  authors  concluded  that  there  is  no  evidence  
that  transplantation  was  superior  to  dose -dense  dose- escalated  therapy.  
Furthermore,  transplantation  was  associated  with  an  increase  in  toxicity 
and a possibly inferior outcome, although the hazard ratios  were not  
significantly  different from  1.  
Gradishar (2007) noted that the clinical trial by SWOG, as well as those that preceded it, has failed to identify a group of breast cancer patients for 
whom HDC confers a significant advantage over non -marrow -ablative 
chemotherapy approaches. Notably, the "standard" chemotherapy 
regimen used for group 1 in this trial should not be viewed as a standard 
regimen for use in routine clinical practice. These doses of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and CY have not proven superior to the lower doses that are 
used more commonly. In fact, previous clinical trials have shown that 
higher doses of doxorubicin, CY , and paclitaxel increase the number of 
adverse events without enhancing outcomes.

In a systematic review and meta- analysis on HDC for poor prognosis 
breast cancer, Fraquhar et al (2007) concluded that there is insufficient 
evidence supporting routine use of HDC with autograft for treating early 
poor prognosis breast cancer. 
In a multi -center, randomized study,  Crump et  al (2008)  examined PFS,  
OS,  and  quality  of  life  in  women  with  MBC  receiving  HDC  plus  autologous  
stem -cell transplantation (ASCT) compared with standard -dose therapy.  
A  total  of  386  women  with  MBC  and  no  prior  chemotherapy  for  metastatic  
disease were registered.  After initial response to anthracycline-  or 
taxane -based i  nduction chemotherapy, 224  patients were r andomly  
assigned:  112 to high- dose CY,  mitoxantrone, and carboplatin 
chemotherapy and ASCT (HDCT), and 112 to standard therapy  (ST).  
Median  age  was  47  years  (range  of  25  to  67  years).  Thirty -two  percent  of 
women randomly assigned had estrogen  and progesterone receptor - 
negative breast  cancer, 42 % had  visceral metastases,  and 58 % had 
bone metastases.  Complete remission rates  before random  assignment  
were 11 % for those receiving HDC  and 12 % for those recei ving ST. 
After  a median follow- up of 48 months, 79 deaths  were observed in the 
HDC  arm  and  77  deaths  were  observed  in  the  ST  arm;  7  patients  (6  %)  in 
the  HDC  arm  died  as  a  result  of  toxicity.  The  median  OS  was  24  months  
for  the  HDC  arm  (95  %  CI:  21  to  35  months)  and  28  months  for  ST  (95  % 
CI:  22  to 33 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.9; 95 % CI: 0.6 to 1.2; p =  
0.43). Progression -free survival was  11 months for  HDC  and 9 months  
for ST (HR, 0.6 in favor of HDCT;  95 %  CI: 0.5 to 0.9; p = 0.006). The 
authors concluded that HDC did not  improve OS  in women with MBC  
when  used  as  consolidation  after  response  to  induction  chemotherapy.  
Ueno et al (2008) reviewed 66 women with poor -risk MBC from 15 
centers to describe the effectiveness of allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT). Median follow- up for survivors was 40 months 
(range of 3 to 64 months). A total of 39 patients (59 %) received myeloablative and 27 (41 %) RIC regimens. More patients in the RIC 
group had poor pre-transplant performance status (63 % versus 26 %, p 
= 0.002). The RIC group developed less chronic graft -versus -host 
disease (GVHD) (8 % versus 36 % at 1 year, p = 0.003). Treatment -
related mortality rates were lower with RIC (7 % versus 29 % at 100 days, 
p = 0.03). A total of 9 of 33 patients (27 %) who underwent immune 
manipulation for persistent or progressive disease had disease control,

suggesting a GVT effect. Progression -free survival at 1 year was 23 % 
with myeloablative conditioning and 8 % with RIC (p = 0.09). Women 
who developed acute GVHD after an RIC regimen had lower risks of 
relapse or progression than those who did not (relative risk, 3.05: p = 
0.03), consistent with a GVT effect, but this did not affect PFS. The 
authors stated that these findings support the need for pre -clinical and 
clinical studies that facilitate targeted adoptive immunotherapy for breast 
cancer to explore the benefit of a GVT effect in breast cancer. 
Fleskens and colleagues (2010) reported the findings of 15 patients with 
chemo- sensitive MBC who underwent RIC allo-SCT between 1999 and 
2006. The pre- transplant conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine 
(25 mg/m(2) at days -5 to - 1) and CY (60 mg/kg at days -2, -1). Stem 
cells were from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)- matched sibling donors. 
The treatment- related mortality was 2/15 (13 %). Median PFS and OS 
were 144 days (43 to 509 days) and 303 days (122 to 1376 days), 
respectively. The 1-year PFS was 20 %, and the 1-year and 2-year OS 
was 40 and 20 %, respective ly. No objective tumor responses were 
observed, but the relatively long PFS does suggest a graft- versus -tumor 
effect. Although RIC using this CY/fludarabine regimen is feasible, the efficacy in this set of patients was limited. The authors concluded that 
future clinical trials should be performed to improve the knowledge of mechanisms of anti -tumor effects in breast cancer. 
Berry et al (2011a) noted that adjuvant HDC with autologous 
hematopoietic stem -cell transplantation (AHST) for high- risk primary 
breast cancer has not been shown to prolong survival. Individual trials have had limited power to show overall benefit or benefits within subsets. 
These investigators assembled individual patient data from 15 randomized trials that compared HDC versus control therapy without 
stem -cell support. Prospectively defined primary end points were 
relapse -free survival (RFS) and OS. They compared the effect of HDC 
versus control by using log -rank tests and proportional hazards 
regression, and adjusted for clinically relevant co -variates. Subset 
analyses were by age, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size, histology, hormone receptor (HmR) status, and human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Of 6,210 total patients (n = 3,118, HDC; 
n = 3,092 control), the median age was 46 years; 69 % were pre­
menopausal, 29 % were post- menopausal, and 2 % were unknown

menopausal status; 49.5 % were HmR -positive; 33.5 % were HmR ­
negative, and 17 % were unknown HmR status. The median follow -up 
was 6 years. After analysis was adjusted for co-variates, HDC was found 
to prolong RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95 % CI: 0.81 to 0.93; p < 0.001) 
but not OS (HR, 0.94; 95 % CI: 0.87 to 1.02; p = 0.13). For OS, no co­
variates had statistically significant interactions with treatment effect, and 
no subsets evinced a significant effect of HDC. Younger patients had a 
significantly better RFS on HDC than did older patients. The authors 
concluded that adjuvant HDC with AHST prolonged RFS in high -risk 
primary breast cancer compared with control, but this did not translate into a significant OS benefit. Whether HDC benefits patients in the 
context of targeted therapies is unknown. 
Berry et al  (2011b)  stated substantial interest in support ing HDC with 
bone  marrow  or  autologous  hematopoietic  stem -cell  transplantation  in  the 
1980s  and 1990s led to the initiation of randomized trials to evaluate its  
effect in the treatment of metastatic  breast  cancer. These 
 
researchers  identified  6  randomized  trials  in  metastatic  breast  cancer  that 
evaluated high doses of chemotherapy with transplant support versus  a 
control  regimen without stem -cell support. They  assembled a single 
database containing individual patient information from these trials. The 
primary analysis of OS was  a log- rank  test comparing high dose versus  
control. They also used Cox proportional  hazards  regression,  adjusting 
for known co -variates. We addressed potential treatment differences  
within  subsets  of  patients.  The  effect  of  HDC  on  OS  was  not  statistically  
different  (median,  2.16 versus  2.02 years; p = 0.08). A statistically  
significant  advantage  in  progression- free  survival  (median  of  0.91  versus  
0.69 years) did not translate into survival benefit. Subset analyses found little evidence that there are groups  of patients  who might benefit  from  
HDC with hematopoietic support.  The authors concluded  that OS of  
patients  with metastatic breast  cancer in the 6 randomized trials  was not  
significantly improved by  HDC;  any benefit from hig h doses was small.  
No identifiable subset of  patients  seems to benefit from  HDC. 
 
Pedrazzoli et al (2014) noted that the effectiveness of HDC and autologous hemopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (AHPCT) for BC 
patients has been an area of intense controversy among the medical 
oncology community. These researchers evaluated the effectiveness and 
toxicity of this procedure in a large cohort of high -risk primary BC patients

who underwent AHPCT in Italy. A total of 1,183 patients receiving HDC 
for high- risk BC (HRBC) (greater than 3 positive nodes) were identified in 
the Italian registry. The median age was 46 years, 62 % of patients were 
pre-menopausal at treatment, 60.1 % had endocrine- responsive tumors, 
and 20.7 % had a HER2- positive tumor. The median number of positive 
lymph nodes (LN) at surgery was 15, with 71.5 % of patients having 
greater than or equal to 10 positive nodes. Seventy -three percent 
received an alkylating agent -based HDC as a single procedure, whereas 
27 % received epirubicin or mitoxantrone -containing HDC, usually within 
a multi- transplantation program. The source of stem cells was peripheral 
blood in the vast majority of patients. Transplantation- related mortality 
was 0.8 %, whereas late cardiac and sec ondary tumor- related mortality 
were around 1 %, overall. With a median follow -up of 79 months, median 
DFS and OS in the entire population were 101 and 134 months, respectively. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that OS was significantly 
better in patients with endocrine -responsive tumors and in patients 
receiving multiple transplantation procedures; HER2 status did not affect 
survival probability. The size of the primary tumor and number of involved 
LN negatively affected OS. Adjuvant HDC with AHPC T has a low 
mortality rate and provided impressive long- term survival rates in patients 
with high- risk primary BC. The authors concluded that these findings 
suggested that this treatment modality should be proposed in selected HRBC patients and further investigated in clinical trials. 
Moreover, an UpToDate review on "Treatment protocols for breast 
cancer" (Brenner et al, 2014) as well as National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network’s clinical practice guideline on "Breast cancer" (Version 3.2014) 
do no t mention the use of stem cell/ hematopoietic cell transplantation as 
a therapeutic option. 
Boudin and associates (2016) evaluated the outcome of patients affected 
with different subtypes of MBC following treatment with HDC and 
autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (AHSCT). All 
consecutive female patients treated for MBC with HDC and AHSCT at the 
Institut Paoli -Calmettes between 2003 and 2012 were included. Patient, 
tumor and treatment characteristics were collected. Patients were 
categorized in 3 subtypes based on hormonal receptor and HER2 status 
of the primary tumor: luminal (L), (HR+/HER2 -), HER2 (HER2+, any HR), 
and triple negative (TN) (HER2 -and HR-). The main objective was the

analysis of OS according to the immunohistochemical (IHC) subtypes. A 
total of 235 patients were included, median age was 46 years (range of 
21 to 62). Median follow up was 53.28 months (95 % CI: 45.12 to 57.6). 
The TN subtype appeared to have the worst prognosis with a median OS 
of 19.68 months (95 % CI: 11.76 to 44.4) compared to 44.64 months (95 
% CI: 40.32 to 67.56) for the luminal subtype and a median OS not reached for the HER2 subtype (p < 0.01). In the multi -variate analysis, 
the TN subtype retained an independent poor prognosis value compared 
to the luminal subtype, with a HR of 2.03 (95 % CI: 1.26 to 3.29, p = 0.037). The authors concluded that HDC -AHSCT did not change the 
prognostic value of IHC subtypes in MBC patients; and OS favorably compared with data available in the literature on similar groups of 
patients. They stated that these findings provided additional information 
and options for patients with MBC and who could potentially benefit of HDC- AHSCT. 
In a retrospective study, Martino and colleagues (2016) evaluated toxicity 
and effectiveness of adjuvant HDC and AHSCT in 583 high- risk BC 
patients (greater than 3 positive nodes) who were transplanted between 1995 and 2005 in Europe. All patients received surgery before transplant, 
and 55 patients (9.5 %) received neoadjuvant treatment before surgery. 
Median age was 47.1 years; 57.3 % of patients were pre-menopausal at 
treatment, 56.5 % had endocrine- responsive tumors, 19.5 % had a 
HER2- negative tumor, and 72.4 % had greater than or equal t o 10 
positive lymph nodes at surgery; 79 % received a single HDC procedure. 
Overall transplant -related mortality was 1.9 %, at 0.9 % between 2001 
and 2005, whereas secondary tumor -related mortality was 0.9 %. With a 
median follow -up of 120 months, OS and DFS rates at 5 and 10 years in 
the whole population were 75 % and 64 % and 58 % and 44 %, respectively. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that rates of OS were 
significantly better in patients with endocrine -responsive tumors, less than 
10 positive lymph nodes, and smaller tumor size; HER2 status did not 
affect survival probability. The authors concluded that adjuvant HDC with 
AHSCT has a low mortality rate and provided impressive long- term 
survival rates in patients with high- risk BC. They stated that these 
findings suggested that this treatment modality should be considered in 
selected high- risk BC patients and further investigated in clinical trials.

In a Cochrane review, Farquhar and colleagues  (2016) compared the 
safety  and  effectiven ess  of  HDC  and  autograft  (either  autologous  BMT  or 
SCT) with conventional chemotherapy  for women with early poor  
prognosis BC.  These investigators searched  the Cochrane Breast  
Cancer  Group Specialized Register,  Medline (1966 to October 2015),  
Embase  (1980  to  October  2015),  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)'s  
International Clinical Trials  Registry Search Platform, and  
ClinicalTrials.gov on October  21, 2015. Randomized controlled trials  
(RCTs) comparing HDC and autograft  (BMT or SCT) versus  
chemotherapy  without  autograft  for  women  with  early  poor  prognos is  BC 
were selected for analysis.  Two review authors selected RCTs,  
independently  extracted  data  and  assessed  risks  of  bias.  They  combined 
data  using  a  Mantel -Haenszel  fixed -effect  model  to  calculate  pooled  risk 
ratios (RRs)  and 95 %  CIs. They  evaluated the quality of  the evidence 
using GRADE  methods. Outcomes were survival rates,  toxicity  and 
quality of life.  The authors  concluded that there is  high- quality evidence 
of  increased  treatment- related  mortality  (TRM)  and  little  or  no  increase  in 
survival  by  using  HDC  with  autograft  for  women  with  early  poor  prognosis  
BC.  
Boudin and associates (2017)  noted that studies  evaluating HDC  with 
autologous  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (HDC -ACSH)  in  the 
treatment of MBC,  locally advanced breast ca ncer (LABC)  and  
inflammatory  breast  cancer (IBC)  have in common lack  of biomarker  
information,  in  particular  the  HER2  status.  In  this  study,  all  consecutive 
female patients treated for BC with HDC  and AHSCT at  Institut  Paoli 
Calmettes  between 2003 and 2012 were  included. Patients were 
categorized  in  3  subtypes  based  on  hormonal  receptor  (HR)  and  HER2  
status  of  the  primary  tumor:  (i)  luminal,  (ii)  (HR+/HER2 -),  and  (iii)  HER2  
(HER2+, any  HR) and  triple negative (TN) (HER2 - and HR -). The main  
objective was the analysis  of  OS according to the IHC subtypes.  A  total  
of  377 patients were included. For  MBC,  the TN subtype appeared to 
have  the worst prognosis with a median OS  of  19.68  months (95 %  CI:  
11.76  to 44.4) compared to 44.64 months (95 %  CI:  40.32 to 67.56) for  
the  luminal  subtype  and  a  median  OS  not  reached  for  the  HER2  subtype 
(p < 0.01). For  IBC, HER2 subgroup appeared to have  the best  
prognosis  with  a  5-year  OS  of  89  %  (95  %  CI:  64  to  97)  compared  to  57  
%  (95 % CI: 33 to 76)  for the TN subgroup (HR  5.38, 95 % CI:  1.14  to

25.44  ;  p = 0.034). For CSLA,  luminal subgroup appeared to have the  
best  prognosis  with  a  5-year  OS  of  92  %  (95  %  CI:  71  to  98)  against  75  % 
(95 %  CI: 46 to 90) for  HER 2 subtype and 70 % (95 % CI: 97 to 88)  for  
TN subtype (p =  0.301).  The authors concluded  that HDC -ACSH did not  
change  the  prognosis  value  of  IHC  subtype  in  BC  patients.  
Karadurmus and colleagues (2018) stated that alloHSCT is primarily used 
in patients with relapsed or high -risk hematologic malignancies, and the 
efficacy of this treatment has been substantially demonstrated. The 
principles of alloHSCT consist of maximal tumor cytoreduction with HDC 
and adequate immunosuppression in order to provide engraftment of 
donor stem cells as well as GVT effect. The controversial and 
disappointing results of studies investigating HDC with autologous stem cell rescue in patients with solid tumors have led to development of novel 
approaches such as adoptive T-cell therapies (ATCT), targeted therapies 
and alloHSCT with RIC regimens, which aim to create and take 
advantage of a GVT effect in order to induce more durable responses. 
The advantages of alloHSCT over autologous HSCT for metastatic BC are mainly 2 -fold: cancer -free graft and immune -mediated GVT effects 
mediated by HLA -compatible donor T- cells. These immune -mediated 
effects led to a transition from a chemotherapy -based approach to an 
immunotherapy -based approach in the management of BC. The switch 
from targeting maximal tumor cytoreduction via HDC to induction of immune GVT effects also gave rise to development of RIC and non­
myeloablative (NMA) regimens instead of conventional myeloablative conditioning regimens. RIC regimens substantially reduced the high 
transplant- related morbidity and mortality, while allowing for a complete 
myeloid/lymphoid engraftment. As a result, alloHSCT may become an 
appropriate treatment option for the elderly and medically fragile patients 
with metastatic BC. The authors concluded that a GVT effect does exist 
against metastatic BC and may play a key role in tumor response. If conditioning regimen -related toxicities are reduced and response rates 
are increased via advances in innovative treatments such as immunotherapy, ATCT and targeted therapies, this tr eatment modality 
might be included in the armamentarium of treatments for BC.
