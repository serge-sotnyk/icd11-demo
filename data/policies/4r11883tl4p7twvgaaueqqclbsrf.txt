this cephalexin product was studied. Given the lack of any clinical or sa fety advantage with this 
product, generic cephalexin capsules are a clinically and economically sensible option.  
 
FDA or Other Governmental Regulatory Approval  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Daxbia is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible isolates of designated 
bacteria including respiratory tract infections, otitis media, skin and skin structure infections, bone 
infections, and genitourinary tract infections. Daxbia carries the same indications as generic 
cephalexin 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg capsules.  
 
Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer -reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited nat ional guidelines.  
 
Daxbia is simply a cephalexin 333 mg containing product. Daxbia has the same exact indications as 
generic cephalexin 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg capsules. There are also no clinical studies in the 
package insert to give insight into any a dvantages of this product. There have been no head to head 
studies of this product versus generic cephalexin in a clinical setting. Based on a review of the 
available data, there is no advantage of using Daxbia over generic cephalexin.

**Medically Necessary (or “Medical Necessity”) - Health care services, treatment, procedures, 
equipment, drugs, devices, items or supplies that a Provider, exercising prudent clinical judgment, 
would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, evaluating, diagnosing or treating an illness, 
injury, disease or its symptoms, and that are: 
A. In accordance with nationally accepted standards of medical practice; 
B. Clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, level of care, site and duration, 
and considered effective for the patient's illness, injury or disease; and 
C. Not primarily for the personal comfort or convenience of the patient, physician or other 
health care provider, and not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services 
at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or 
treatment of that patient's illness, injury or disease. 
For these purposes, “nationally accepted standards of medical practice” means standards that  are 
based on credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community, Physician Specialty Society recommendations and 
the views of Physicians practicing in relevant clinical areas and any other relevant factors.
