Ovarian Cancer Tumor Markers
DESCRIPTION
A variety of substances, including enzymes, hormones, 
antigens, and proteins, can be detected in higher-than-normal
amounts 
in the blood, urine, or body tissues of some individuals with certain 
types of cancer. These tumor markers may be
produced by a tumor itself 
or by the body's response to the presence of cancer. The detection of 
tumor markers may be
used to determine a diagnosis, disease progression, 
or response to treatment; however, these markers may also be
elevated 
in individuals with benign conditions. The use of tumor markers for diagnosing 
ovarian cancer is insufficient in the
absence of a comprehensive evaluation 
that includes abdominal/pelvic examination.
The most extensively 
studied serum marker is cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), which is a protein 
associated with epithelial
ovarian malignancies. Elevation of CA-125 levels 
may occur in endometriosis, pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease and
in other types of cancer. CA-125 appears to be most useful in identifying 
nonmucinous epithelial cancer. Other tumor
markers (e.g., alpha fetoprotein, 
beta human chorionic gonadotropin, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, 
Inhibin and lactate
dehydrogenase) can be elevated in less common ovarian 
histopathologies (e.g., carcinosarcomas, clear cell carcinoma,
mucinous 
carcinoma, low-grade [grade 1] serous/endometrioid epithelial carcinoma, 
borderline epithelial tumors, malignant
sex cord-stromal tumors and malignant 
germ cell tumor).
Human epididymis 
protein 4 (HE4) is a novel biomarker proposed as a replacement for or 
a complement to CA-125 for
screening asymptomatic women and evaluating 
women with ovarian masses and monitoring ovarian cancer progression and
recurrence. Data show that HE4 does not increase early enough to be useful 
in the detection of early-stage ovarian cancer.
There are also limited 
data on the diagnostic test performance of the HE4 test used to monitor 
disease progression and
recurrence in women after initial treatment for 
epithelial ovarian cancer.
POLICY
The measurement of ovarian 
cancer tumor markers is considered 
medically necessary
 
if the medical
appropriateness criteria are met. 
(See Medical Appropriateness 
below.)
The measurement of multiple 
ovarian cancer tumor markers is considered 
not medically necessary.
The measurement of ovarian 
cancer tumor markers that do not meet medical appropriateness criteria 
including, but
not limited to human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) are 
considered 
investigational.
MEDICAL 
APPROPRIATENESS
The measurement of ovarian 
cancer tumor markers is considered 
medically appropriate
 if 
ALL
 of the following are
met:
Symptomatic 
individual
Measured 
during initial workup or post-operative monitoring
Request 
for measurement of 
ANY 
ONE
 of the following tumor markers:
Alpha 
fetoprotein (AFP)
Beta 
human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG)
Cancer 
Antigen 125 (CA-125)
Carcinoembryonic 
Antigen (CEA)
CA 
19-9
Inhibin
Lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH)
IMPORTANT REMINDERS
Any 
specific products referenced in this policy are just examples and 
are intended for illustrative purposes only. It is not
intended to 
be a recommendation of one product over another and is not intended 
to represent a complete listing of all
products available. These examples 
are contained in the parenthetical e.g. statement.
We 
develop Medical Policies to provide guidance to Members and Providers. This 
Medical Policy relates only to the
services or supplies described 
in it. The existence of a Medical Policy is not an authorization, 
certification, explanation
of benefits or a contract for the service 
(or supply) that is referenced in the Medical Policy. For a determination 
of the
benefits that a Member is entitled to receive under his or 
her health plan, the Member's health plan must be
reviewed. If 
there is a conflict between the Medical Policy and a health plan or 
government program (e.g., TennCare),
the express terms of the health 
plan or government program will govern.
ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION
There 
is insufficient evidence to support the measurement of tumor markers not 
referenced within the medical
appropriateness criteria and for testing 
asymptomatic, average risk individuals.
