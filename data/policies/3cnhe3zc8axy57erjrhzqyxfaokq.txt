tumors)  
Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma  
Lutetium  Lu 177 dotatate (Lutathera)  is  a radiolabeled somatostatin analog.  
Lutetium  Lu 177 dotatate binds  to somatostatin receptors  with highest  
affinity  for  subtype 2 receptors  (SSRT2).  Upon binding to  somatostatin 
receptor  expressing cells,  including malignant  somatostatin receptorpositive 
tumors,  the compound is  internalized.  The beta emission  from  Lu 177 
induces  cellular  damage by  formation of  free radicals  in somatostatin 
receptor -positive  cells  and in  neighboring cells  (Advanced Accelerator  
Applications  USA,  2020).  
Lutathera 
carries the following warnings and precautions: 
Risk from radiation exposure: Minimize radiation exposure during and  
after treatment with Lutathera consistent with institutional good radiation  safety practices and patient management procedures  
Myelosuppress
ion: Monitor blood cell counts. Withhold, reduce dose,  
or permanently discontinue based on severity.  
Secondary myel
odysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia: Median time  
to development: MDS is 28 months; acute leukemia is 55 months.  
Renal toxici
ty: Advise patients to urinate frequently during and after  
administration of Lutathera. Monitor serum creatinine and calculated  
creatinine clearance. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently  
discontinue based on severity.  
Hepatotoxici
ty: Monitor transaminases, bilirubin and albumin.  
Neuroendocrine horm
onal crisis: Monitor for flushing, diarrhea,  
hypotension, bronchoconstriction or other signs and symptoms.  
Embryo- fetal  toxicity:  Can cause fetal  harm.  Advise females  and males  of   
reproductive potential  of  the potential  risk  to a fetus  and to use eﬀective  
contraception.  
Risk of Infertility. 
The most common Grade 3- 4 adverse reactions (≥ 4% with a higher incidence in the Lutathera arm) are lymphopenia, 
increased GGT, vomiting, nausea, increased AST, increased ALT, hyperglycemia and hypokalemia.

Somatostatin Receptor -Positive Gastroenteropancreatic 
Neuroendocrine Tumors (GEP -NETs) 
On January  26, 2018, The FDA approved lutetium Lu 177 dotatate 
(Lutathera) in adult patients for  the treatment of  somatostatin receptor - 
positive gastroenteropancreatic  neuroendocrine tumors  (GEP- NETs). This  
is the first time a radioactive drug, or radiopharmaceutical, has been 
approved for the treatment of GEP -NETs. Lutathera was approved under 
priority review and received Orphan Drug designation. GEP -NETs can be 
present in the pancreas and in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the stomach, intestines, colon and rectum. It is estimated that 
approximately one out of 27,000 people are diagnosed with GEP -NETs 
per year. 
Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is a radioactive drug that binds to a part of a cell 
called a somatostatin receptor, which may be present on certain tumors. 
After binding to the receptor, the drug enters the cell allowing radiation to 
cause damage to the tumor cells. 
The approval of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate was supported by two studies. 
In the NETTER- 1 trial, Strosberg et al (2017) stated patients with 
advanced midgut neuroendocrine tumors who have had disease 
progression during first -line somatostatin analogue therapy have limited 
therapeutic options. This randomized, controlled trial evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of lutetium -177 (177Lu) -Dotatate in patients with 
advanced, progressive, somatostatin- receptor- positive midgut 
neuroendocrine tumors. The study randomly assigned 229 patients who had well- differentiated, metastatic midgut neuroendocrine tumors to 
receive either 177Lu -Dotatate (116 patients) at a dose of 7.4 GBq every 8 
weeks (four intravenous infusions, plus best supportive care including octreotide long-acting repeatable [LAR] administered intramuscularly at a 
dose of 30 mg) (177Lu- Dotatate group) or octreotide LAR alone (113 
patients) administered intramuscularly at a dose of 60 mg every 4 weeks 
(control group). The primary end point was progression -free survival.       
 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) -Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna Page 6 of 12 
Secondary end points included the objective response rate,  overall  
survival,  safety, and the side- effect profile.  The final analysis of overall  
survival  will  be  conducted  in  the  future  as  specified  in  the  protocol;  a  pre- 
specified interim analysis of overall survival  was  conducted and is  
reported  here. At the data -cutoff date for the primary analysis,  the 
estimated  rate  of  progression -free  survival  at  month  20  was  65.2%  (95%  
confidence interval [CI],  50.0 to 76.8) in the 177Lu -Dotatate group and 
10.8%  (95%  CI,  3.5  to  23.0)  in  the  control  group.  The  response  rate  was 
18% i n the 177Lu -Dotatate group versus  3% i n the control group 
(P<0.001). In the planned interim analysis  of overall  survival, 14 deaths  
occurred in the 177Lu-D otatate group and 26 in the control group 
(P=0.004).  Grade 3 or  4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and 
lymphopenia  occurred  in  1%,  2%,  and  9%,  respectively,  of  patients  in  the 
177Lu -Dotatate  group  as  compared  with  no  patients  in  the  control  group,  
with  no  evidence  of  renal  toxic  effects  during  the  observed  time  frame.  
The authors  concluded that treatment  with 177Lu- Dotatate resulted in 
markedly longer  progression- free survival and a significantly higher  
response rate than high -dose octreotide LAR among patients with 
advanced midgut  neuroendocrine tumors. Preliminary  evidence of an 
overall  survival  benefit  was  seen  in  an  interim  analysis;  confirmation  will 
be required in the planned final analysis.  Clinically  significant  
myelosuppression occurred in less  than  10%  of  patients  in the 177Lu-  
Dotatate  group.  
The second study,  ERASMUS, was  based on data patients with 
somatostatin receptor -positive tumors, including GEP -NETS, who  
received  lutetium  Lu 177  dotatate at a single site in the Netherlands. A  
total of 1214 patients received lutetium Lu 177  dotatate,  of which 601 
(50%)  were  assessed  per  RECIST  criteria.  Of  the  601  patients  evaluated 
by investigators using  RECIST  criteria, 360 (60%) had  
gastroenteropancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumors  (GEP- NETs). Lutetium  Lu 
177 dotatate 7.4 GBq (200 mCi)  was administered every  6 to 13  weeks  
for  up  to  4  doses  concurrently  with  the  recommended  amino  acid  solution.  
The  major  efficacy  outcome  was  investigator -assessed  ORR.  The  median 
age  in  the  efficacy  subset  was  61  years  (25  to  88  years),  52%  were  male,  
61%  had  a  baseline  Karnofsky  performance  status  ≥  90  (60  to  100),  60%  
had  progressed within 12 months  of  treatment,  and 15%  had received 
prior chemotherapy. Fifty five percent (55%) of patients  received a  
concomitant  somatostatin  analog.  The  median  dose  of  lutetium  Lu  177    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
        
         Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) -Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna Page 7 of 12 
dotatate was 29.6 GBq (800 mCi). Baseline tumor assessments were 
obtained in 39% of patients. The investigator assessed ORR was 16% 
(95% CI 13, 20) in the 360 patients with GEP -NETs. Three complete 
responses were observed (< 1%). Median DoR in the 58 responding 
patients was 35 months (95% CI: 17, 38).
