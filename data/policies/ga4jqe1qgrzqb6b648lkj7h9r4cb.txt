Description of Procedure or Service
Amondys-45 (formerly SRP-4045) is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to bind to exon 45 of dystrophin pre-mRNA. This results
in the exclusion or skipping of exon 45 which allows for production of dystrophin that is truncated, but still partially functional. It is
estimated that approximately 8% of patients may be amenable to exon 45 skipping. Dystrophin is the protein that is absent in patients
with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) which results in muscle damage and progressive dysfunction.
II
. 
Policy
Amondys-45™ (casimersen) is considered not medically necessary for all indications including treatment of Duchenne’s muscular
dystrophy.
Note: There is insufficient clinical evidence for demonstrated efficacy.
III
. 
Key Points 
Current treatment options for DMD focus on symptomatic management and prevention of complications. The mainstay of treatment
is to offer patients glucocorticoids which have been confirmed to improve motor strength and function, pulmonary function, reduce
the risk of scoliosis, and may delay the onset of cardiomyopathy. Current guidelines recommend initiation of glucocorticoids (such as
prednisone) once patients reach a plateau of motor skill development, generally at age 4-6 years, but prior to onset of motor decline.
Other therapies include ACE-inhibitors or Beta-blockers for cardiac disease, immunizations, pain management, respiratory support,
and comorbidity surveillance. Eteplirsen was approved September of 2016 for the treatment of DMD in patients with a confirmed
mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. Golodirsen and viltolarsen were approved (December 2019 and
August 2020 respectively) for the treatment of DMD in patients with a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon
53 skipping.
In much the same way as the aforementioned exon-skipping therapies, casimersen approval occurred following priority review as an
accelerated approval allowing for use of a surrogate endpoint (contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in ongoing
confirmatory clinical trials) of dystrophin increase in skeletal muscle observed in patients. Sarepta received FDA approval February
25, 2021. Whether the increase in truncated dystrophin level seen in the trial is reasonably likely to confer a clinical benefit remains
to be elucidated. The below excerpts from the clinical study elaborate upon the question of clinical benefit posited with casimersen
treatment.

Clinical Trials and FDA Review 
Study 1/ESSENCE/4045-301 (NCT02500381)
Patients in this Phase 3 trial were required to be ambulatory males between 7 and 13 years of age (median 9 years) on a stable dose
of corticosteroids for at least 24 weeks with a mutation in the DMD gene amenable to exon 45 skipping. This is an ongoing,
multicenter, two-part study. Part 1 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled 96-week treatment period which will be followed by a 48-
week open-label treatment period (Part 2). Interim efficacy was assessed based on change from baseline in dystrophin biopsy at
week 48 of Part 1. There were 43 evaluable patients (n=27 casimersen; n=16 placebo) assessed for dystrophin by Sarepta Western
blot. The change from baseline mean were 0.22 and 0.81 for placebo and casimersen respectively which equates to a between
group mean difference of 0.59 (p=0.004). The primary outcome measure is change from baseline in the total distance walked during
6MWT at Week 96 with an estimated primary completion date for the study of May 2022 (estimated study completion date May
2023).
