IMPORTANT 
REMINDER
 
We develop Medical Policies 
to provide guidance to Members and Providers.  This Medical 
Policy relates only to the
services or supplies described in it.  The 
existence of a Medical Policy is not an authorization, certification, 
explanation of
benefits or a contract for the service (or supply) that 
is referenced in the Medical Policy.  For a determination of 
the benefits
that a Member is entitled to receive under his or her health 
plan, the Member's health plan must be reviewed.  If there is 
a
conflict between the medical policy and a health plan or government 
program (e.g., TennCare), the express terms of the
health plan or government 
program will govern.
 
DESCRIPTION
 
Azacitidine is a nucleoside 
metabolic inhibitor which is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine.  Its 
antineoplastic effects
are thought to be from the hypomethylation of DNA.  Azacitidine 
exerts direct cytotoxicity on hematopoietic cells in the bone
marrow where 
it causes the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells 
which are no longer responsive to normal
growth control mechanisms.  Cells 
which are non-proliferative are relatively unaffected by azacitidine.
