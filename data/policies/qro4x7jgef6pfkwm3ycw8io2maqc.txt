Colony Stimulating Factors (G-CSF & GM-CSF)
Content
: 
1. PURPOSE
To define the medical appropriateness of colony stimulating factors (G-CSF &
GM-CSF). 
To define the prior authorization guidelines for colony stimulating factors (G-
CSF & GM-CSF).
2. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this policy is to provide general information applicable to the
administration of outpatient prescription drug benefits that Horizon NJ Health
administers for the NJ Family Care/Medicaid members. 
This policy applies to the Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare plans issued and/or
administered by Horizon Healthcare Services, Inc. d/b/a Horizon Blue Cross
Blue Shield of New Jersey and/or its affiliates, including Horizon Healthcare of
New Jersey, Inc. d/b/a Horizon NJ Health (collectively â€œHorizonâ€
​
).
If a memberâ€™s contract benefits, as set forth in the NJ Medicaid State
Contract differ from a pharmacy policy, the Contract prevails. 
Applicable
Federal and/or State regulations must be considered in the determinations.
Although a prescription drug may be medically necessary, it may be subject to
limitations and/or exclusions under a memberâ€™s benefit plan. 
If a
prescription drug is not covered and the member proceeds to obtain the
prescription drug, the member may be responsible for the cost. Decisions
regarding treatment and treatment plans are the responsibility of the physician.
This policy is not intended to direct the course of clinical care a physician
provides to a member, and does not replace a physicianâ€™s or
pharmacistâ€™s independent professional clinical judgment or duty to exercise
special knowledge and skill in the treatment of Horizon NJ Health members.
Horizon NJ Health is not responsible for, does not provide, and does not hold
itself out as a provider of medical care. 
The physician remains responsible for
the quality and type of health care services provided to a Horizon NJ Health
member.
Horizon NJ Healthâ€™s Pharmacy Policies do not constitute medical
advice, authorization, certification, approval, explanation of benefits, offer
of coverage, contract or guarantee of payment.
POLICY STATEMENT: This policy defines the scope and process of colony
stimulating factors (G-CSF & GM-CSF) coverage for Horizon NJ Health
members.
This policy ensures that colony stimulating factors (G-CSF & GM-CSF) are
used for FDA-approved indications and medically appropriate â€œoff-labelâ€
​
uses at appropriate dosages for the purposes listed below. 
The prior
authorization process will begin when providers or members initially contact
Horizon NJ Health for pre-approval. 
Clinical information will be attempted to be
obtained in a timely basis after initiation of the prior authorization request.
Clinical decisions regarding approvals will be made by the clinical staff whileclinical decisions for denials will only be made by the medical directors.
Providers and/or members will be notified regarding final decisions.
Pharmacy Policies can be highly technical and are designed for use by the
Horizon NJ Health professional staff in making coverage determinations.
Members referring to a Horizon NJ Health pharmacy policy should discuss it
with their treating physician or pharmacist, and should refer to their specific
benefit plan for the terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions of their
coverage.
Horizon NJ Healthâ€™s Pharmacy Policies are proprietary. 
They may be used
only as authorized by Horizon NJ Health and its owner or affiliates. 
The
contents of the Horizon NJ Health Pharmacy Policies are not to be copied,
reproduced or circulated to other parties without the express written consent of
Horizon NJ Health. 
The contents of these Pharmacy Policies may be updated
or changed without notice, unless otherwise required by law and/or regulation.
Benefit determinations are made in the context of policies existing at the time of
the decision and are not subject to later revision as the result of a change in
policy.
This policy was developed in accordance with applicable Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines, the NJ Medicaid Managed Care
Contract, applicable NJ State and Federal Guidelines, and national
accreditation standards. This policy will be reviewed annually, revising
procedures as necessary to reflect changes to specific guidelines. 
The Director of Pharmacy or his/her designee will conduct an annual review of
this policy and procedure to ensure that it is still relevant and compliant with
appropriate New Jersey State and Federal Medicaid regulatory and accrediting
requirements, and accurately reflects current operations.
3. POLICY
3.1. 
POLICY OVERSIGHT
The Director of Pharmacy Services is responsible for ensuring that the policy is
in accordance with State Medicaid contract and all accrediting bodies. 
Auditing
will be done annually to ensure that this policy is being applied fairly and
consistently.
3.2.
 
POLICY PLANNING AND REPORTING
The pharmacy department reviews and reports to the Pharmacy and
Therapeutics (P&T) committee on an annual basis approvals/denials of
medications requiring prior authorization. 
In addition, a quarterly report of
denials is generated by the Pharmacy Department and submitted to DMAHS.
Pharmacists are audited and are provided feedback on prior authorization
request performance on a quarterly basis to ensure that approvals and
recommendations for denials are done in accordance with policy criteria. 
The
pharmacy call center staff is audited and provided feedback on prior
authorization request performance on a monthly basis to ensure that correct
information is being captured and entered into that pharmacy system on a
timely basis. 
Medical Directors are audited annually on interrator reliability
concerning pharmacy cases. 
The results of the pharmacist, pharmacy call
center, and medical director performance on these audits are reported annually
to the P&T committee.
3.3.
 
POLICY DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS
This Horizon NJ Health Pharmacy Policy has been developed by Horizon NJ
Healthâ€™s Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and Quality Improvement
Committee, which include practicing physicians and pharmacists. 
The Policy is
consistent with generally accepted standards of medical and pharmacy
practice, and reflects Horizon NJ Healthâ€™s view of the subject prescription
drugs, and in what circumstances they are deemed to be medically necessaryor experimental/ investigational in nature. 
The Pharmacy Policy also considers,
in part, whether and to what degree the subject prescription drug is clinically
appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, site and duration and if they
are considered effective for the illnesses, injuries or diseases discussed.
Where relevant, this Pharmacy Policy considers whether the subject
prescription drug is being requested primarily for the convenience of the
covered person or the health care provider. 
It also considers whether the
prescription drug ordered is more costly than an alternative, equally effective
prescription drug that is at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or
diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or treatment of the relevant illness, injury
or disease. 
In reaching its conclusion regarding what it considers to be the
generally accepted standards of medical and pharmacy practice, the Pharmacy
and Therapeutics Committee reviews and considers the following: 
all credible
scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally
recognize d by the relevant medical community, physician and health care
provider specialty society recommendations, the views of physicians,
pharmacists and health care providers practicing in relevant clinical areas
(including, but not limited to, the prevailing opinion within the appropriate
specialty), the findings and directives of the Food and Drug Administration, 
and
any other relevant factor as determined by applicable State and Federal laws
and regulations.

G-CSF and GM-CSF are naturally occurring glycoprotein cytokines. 
Together, G-CSFand GM-CSF exert major control over the reproduction and maturation of committed
myeloid-lineage progenitor cells.
Filgrastim is a human G-CSF, produced by recombinant DNA technology. 
G-CSF
regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow; endogenous G-CSF is a
glycoprotein produced by monocyte, fibroblast, and endothelial cells. 
G-CSF has been
shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production of other
hematopoietic cell types. 
Pegfilgrastim is a conjugate of recombinant G-CSF and
monomethoxypoly-ethylene glycol with a longer duration of action. 
Sargramostim is a
human GM-CSF also produced by recombinant DNA technology. 
GM-CSF induces
partially committed progenitor cells to divide and differentiate in the granulocyte-
macrophage pathways. 
It is also capable of activating mature granulocytes and
macrophages and promoting proliferation of megakaryocytic and erythroid progenitors. 
Filgrastim, sargramostim, pegfilgrastim, and tbo-filgrastim prevent/treat neutropenia.
Neutropenia is defined as a decrease in neutrophils. ANC is a way of measuring the
neutrophil count. 
It is defined as white blood cell (cell/mcL) x (PMN % + bands %) / 100.
When the ANC falls below 500, the infection risk significantly increases. 
Therefore, by
using these agents, one may have reduced the probability of developing infections. 
Specifically, NCCN guidelines defines febrile neutropenia (Temperature: â‰¥ 38.3Â°C
orally or â‰¥ 38.0Â°C for duration over 1 hour); and neutropenia <500 neutrophils/mcL
or <1,000 neutrophils/mcL and a predicted decline to â‰¤500 neutrophils/mcL over the
next 48 hours
Table 1 illustrates the relationship between ANC and risk of infection.

1. 
Per NCCN Hematopoietic Growth Factors 2.2020 guidelines, â€œalthough
there are no biosimilars designated as interchangeable by the FDA, limited
data suggest that patients can alternate between the biosimilar and the
originator biologic without any clinically meaningful differences regarding
efficacy or safety. Based on recent FDA approvals and review of the data,
Filgrastim-sndz, Filgrastim-aafi, pegfilgrastim-jmdb, pegfilgrastim-cbqv,
pegfilgrastim-bmezâ€¦have been included in the NCCN Guidelines as
appropriate substitutions for originator Filgrastim [and] pegfilgrastim. Although
a potential concern regarding immunogenicity exists regarding biosimilars,
immunogenicity is anticipated to be low to nonexistent in filgrastim biosimilarsbased on the lack of immunogenicity seen with filgrastim and the nature of
filgrastim as an unglycosylated protein.â€
​
2. 
The most current NCCN Hematopoietic Growth Factors guideline is available
at 
ht
 
https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/growthfactors.pdf
.
Included in the guideline are:
Â· 
Examples of Disease Settings and Chemotherapy Regimens with
a High Risk for Febrile Neutropenia (>20%)
Â· 
Examples of Disease Settings and Chemotherapy Regimens with
an Intermediate Risk for Febrile Neutropenia (10-20%)
Â· 
Additional Evaluation of Patient Risk Factors for Prophylactic Use
of MGFs
Â· 
Therapeutic Use of MGFs
Â· 
MGFs in Mobilization and Post Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
3. 
Per NCCN Hematopoietic Growth Factors 2.2020 guidelines: Febrile
neutropenia is defined as single temperature: â‰¥ 38.3Â°C orally or â‰¥
38.0Â°C for duration over 1 hour; neutropenia: <500 neutrophils/mcL or <1,000
neutrophils/mcL and a predicted decline to â‰¤ 500mcL over the next 48 hour
4. 
According to NCCN
 
Hematopoietic Growth Factors 2.2020 guidelines, there
are no studies which have addressed therapeutic use of filgrastim for febrile
neutropenia in patients who have already received prophylactic pegfilgrastim.
However, pharmacokinetic data of pegfilgrastim demonstrated high levels
during neutropenia and suggests that additional CSF will not be beneficial.
However, in patients with prolonged neutropenia additional G-CSFs may be
considered
5. 
Per ASCO 2002 guidelines, â€œseveral small studies of CSFs in patients
undergoing large-field irradiation have demonstrated that CSFs may help
ameliorate the effect of radiation on neutropenia. However, it should be noted
that the thrombocytopenia observed might be unique to this site of irradiation
and only in the setting of combined chemoradiation. At present, the routine use
of CSF in this setting should be avoided unless studied as part of a clinical trial
with appropriate monitoring of thrombocytopenia and pulmonary toxicity. CSF
use to support large-field irradiation may have benefits, but further studies are
required to recommend this usage. CSF use in conjunction with radiation has
not been studied extensively, and further studies are required to ascertain the
optimal sequencing
6. 
According to ASCO 2015 Update of Recommendations for the Use of White
Blood Cell Growth Factors: Accidental/intentional total body radiation leads to
probable or certain death from bone marrow failure at doses of 3 to 10 Grays
without supportive care, CSFs, and/or a bone marrow transplant. Doses below
that level are almost always survivable with excellent nursing care, and higher
doses are lethal because of injury to other organs such as the gastrointestinal
tract. Although no prospective, randomized trials have been carried out to
determine the benefit of hematopoietic growth factors in humans exposed to
accidental or intentional (e.g., resulting from a terrorist attack or war) radiation
injury, they have been utilized in radiation accident victims, and neutrophil
recovery appears to have been hastened in 25 of 28 cases (REACT/TS
registry). In animal models, prompt administration of hematopoietic growth
factors after otherwise lethal total body radiation exposure dramatically
increases survival
7. 
According to NCCN Myelodysplastic Syndromes guideline 2.2018, For the
erythroid synergistic effect, relatively low doses of G-CSF are needed to help
normalize the neutrophil count in initially neutropenic patients or to double the
neutrophil count in patients who are initially non-neutropenicâ€¦an average of
1-2 mcg/kg subcutaneous G-CSF is administered either daily or 1 to 2 times
per week. 
Detection of erythroid responses generally occurs within 6-8 weeks
of treatment. If no response occurs within this time frame, treatment should be
considered a failure and discontinued. 
In the case of treatment failure, one
should rule out and treat deficient iron stores). This treatment is not suggested
for patients with endogenous sEpo levels greater than 500 mU/mL due to the
very low erythroid response rate to these drugs in this patient population. In
patients who do not respond by 3 months or who have an erythroid response
that is followed by a loss of response, lenalidomide may be combined withESAs, with or without G-CSF.
8. 
Per NCCN Myelodysplastic Syndromes guidelines, prognostic categories for
lower risk include:
Â· 
Low or intermediate-1 risk category based on International
Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)
Â· 
Very low, low, or intermediate risk category based on Revised
IPSS (IPSS-R) 
Â· 
Very low, low, or intermediate risk category based on WHO-based
prognostic scoring system (WPSS)
9. 
Per NCCN Acute Myeloid Leukemia for members younger than 60 years old
an option for treatment induction is: Fludarabine 30mg/m
2
 IV days 2-6, HiDAC
(High dose cytarabine) 2g/m
2
 over 4 hours starting 4 hours after fludarabine on
days 2-6, idarubicin 8mg/m
2
 IV days 4-6, and G-CSF subcutaneously daily on
days 1-7 Â± single dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin 3mg/m2 in first course
10. 
Per NCCN Hematopoietic Growth Factors 2.2019 guidelines, for allogeneic
hematopoietic cell donors, dose is 10-16 mcg/kg/day by subcutaneous
injection, start collection on day 4 or 5. For granulocyte transfusion: single dose
5mcg/kg subcutaneously with dexamethasone 10mg 8-24 hours prior to
collection
11. 
Per NCCN Hematopoietic Growth Factors 2.2020 guidelines, patients with
idiopathic and cyclic neutropenia generally responded to low-dose daily,
alternate-day, or thrice-per-week subcutaneous G-CSF administration (1-3
mcg/kg per day). Congenital neutropenia patients generally require higher
doses (3-10mcg/kg/day). All patients should have doses adjusted to maintain a
blood neutrophil level in the normal or low-normal range.]
