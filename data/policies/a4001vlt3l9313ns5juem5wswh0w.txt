Patient Selection Criteria 
Coverage eligibility may be considered for home ultraviolet light therapy when ALL of the following 
criteria are met: 
• The device must be approved for home use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
appropriate for the body surface and area treated; AND.  
• The member has generalized vitiligo affecting > 10% of body surface area, with documented 
response to in -office phototherapy, for which narrowband ultraviolet B (NB -UVB) is 
prescribed and indicated; AND  
• Long -term maintenance  UV light treatment is planned and patient is unable to attend office 
based treatment; AND

The use of home ultraviolet light therapy when patient selection criteria are not met is considered to 
be investigational.*  
 
Policy Guidelines  
The following therapies are currently being used to treat vitiligo: topical medications and 
narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) light therapy (in office or home). The most appropriate 
comparison for targeted phototherapy (e.g. excimer laser or excimer lamp) is NB-UVB, which is 
considered a standard treatment for active and/or widespread vitiligo based on efficacy and safety. 
 
During psoralen plus ultraviolet A therapy, the patient needs to be assessed on a regular basis to 
determine the effectiveness of the therapy and the development of side effects. These evaluations

are essential to ensure that the exposure dose of radiation is kept to the minimum compatible with 
adequate control of t he disease. Therefore, psoralen plus ultraviolet A is generally not recommended 
for home therapy.  
 
Background/Overview  
Vitiligo 
Vitiligo is an idiopathic skin disorder that causes depigmentation of sections of skin, most commonly 
on the extremities. Depigmentation occurs because melanocytes are no longer able to function 
properly. The cause of vitiligo is unknown; it is sometimes considered an autoimmune disease. The 
most common form of the disorder is nonsegmental vitiligo in which depigmentation is generalized, 
bilateral, symmetrical, and increases in size over time. In contrast, segmental vitiligo, also called 
asymmetric or focal vitiligo, covers a limited area of skin. The typical natural history of vitiligo 
involves stepwise progression with long periods in which the disease is static and relatively inactive, 
and relatively shorter periods in which areas of pigment loss increase. 
 
Treatment 
There are numerous medical and surgical treatments aimed at decreasing disease progression and/or 
attaining repigmentation. Topical corticosteroids, alone or in combination with topical vitamin 
D3 analogues, are common first-line treatments for vitiligo. Alternative first-line therapies include 
topical calcineurin inhibitors, systemic steroids, and topical antioxidants. Treatment options for 
vitiligo recalcitrant to first-line therapy include, among others, light box therapy with narrowband 
ultraviolet B and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). 
 
Targeted phototherapy with handheld lamps or lasers is also being evaluated. Potential advantages 
of targeted phototherapy include the ability to use higher treatment doses and to limit exposure to 
surrounding tissue. Original ultraviolet B devices consisted of a Phillips TL-01 fluorescent bulb with 
a maximum wavelength (lambda max) of 311 nm. Subsequently, xenon chloride lasers and lamps 
were developed as targeted ultraviolet B treatment devices; these devices generate monochromatic 
or very narrowband radiation with a lambda max of 308 nm. Targeted phototherapy devices are 
directed at specific lesions or affected areas, thus limiting exposure to the surrounding normal 
tissues. They may, therefore, allow higher dosages compared with a lightbox, which could result in 
fewer treatments.

Psoralen plus ultraviolet A uses a psoralen derivative in conjunction with long -wavelength 
ultraviolet A (UVA) light (sunlight or artificial) for photochemotherapy of skin conditions. Psora lens 
are tricyclic furocoumarins that occur in certain plants and can also be synthesized. They are 
available in oral and topical forms. Oral PUVA is generally given 1.5 hours before exposure to UVA 
radiation. Topical PUVA therapy refers to the direct appl ication of psoralen to the skin with 
subsequent exposure to UVA light. With topical PUVA, UVA exposure is generally administered 
within 30 minutes of psoralen application.  
 
FDA or Other Governmental Regulatory Approval  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
In 2001, XTRAC™‡ (PhotoMedex), a xenon chloride (XeCl) excimer laser, was cleared for 
marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the 510(k) process for the 
treatment of skin conditions such as vitiligo. The 510(k) clearance has subsequently been obtained 
for a number of targeted UVB lamps and lasers, including newer versions of the XTRAC system 
including the XTRAC Ultra™‡, the VTRAC™‡ lamp (PhotoMedex), the BClear™‡ lamp (Lumenis), 
the 308 excimer lamp phototherapy system (Quantel Medical), MultiClear Multiwavelength 
Targeted Phototherapy System, Psoria-Light™‡, and the Excilite™‡ and Excilite µ™‡ XeCl lamps. 
The intended use of all of these devices includes vitiligo among other dermatologic indications. 
Some light-emitting devices are handheld.  
 
FDA product code: GEX. 
 
The oral psoralen product, Oxsoralen-Ultra (methoxsalen soft gelatin capsules), has been approved 
by the FDA and is made by Bausch Health; a generic product is also available from various 
manufacturers. Topical psoralen products (Oxsoralen; Valeant Pharmaceuticals) and methoxsalen 
hard gelatin capsules have been discontinued. 
 
Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer -reviewed medical literature 
generally recogni zed by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal re gulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines.

Description 
Vitiligo is an idiopathic skin disorder that causes depigmentation of sections of skin, most commonly 
on the extremities. Topical corticosteroids, alone or in combination with topical vitamin 
D3 analogues, are common first-line treatments for vitiligo. Alternative first-line therapies include 
topical calcineurin inhibitors, systemic steroids, and topical antioxidants. Treatment options for 
vitiligo recalcitrant to first-line therapy include, among others, ultraviolet B, light box therapy, and 
psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). Targeted phototherapy is also being evaluated. 
 
Summary of Evidence 
For individuals who have vitiligo who receive targeted phototherapy, the evidence includes 
systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 2 individual RCTs, and 2 retrospective 
studies. Relevant outcomes are a change in disease status, quality of life, and treatment-related 
morbidity. Individual studies tend to have small sample sizes, and few were designed to isolate the 
effect of laser therapy. Two meta-analyses were attempted; however, results from a meta-analysis 
could not be verified because the selected studies were not available in English, and 1 estimate was 
imprecise due to the small number of studies and participants. Randomized controlled trials have 
shown targeted phototherapy to be associated with statistically significant improvements in Vitiligo 
Area Scoring Index scores and/or repigmentation compared to alternate treatment options. However, 
1 of the RCTs only showed marginal differences between groups in these outcomes, limiting clinical 
significance; the second compared phototherapy to oral vitamin E, which is not an optimal 
comparator. Overall, there is a lack of clinical trial evidence that compares targeted phototherapy 
with more conservative treatments or no treatment/placebo. The evidence is insufficient to determine 
that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals who have vitiligo who have not responded to conservative therapy who receive 
PUVA (photochemotherapy), the evidence includes systematic reviews and RCTs. Relevant 
outcomes are a change in disease status, quality of life, and treatment-related morbidity. There is 
some evidence from randomized studies, mainly those published before 1985, that PUVA is more 
effective than a placebo for treating vitiligo. When compared with narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-
UVB) in meta-analyses, results have shown that patients receiving NB-UVB experienced higher 
rates of repigmentation than patients receiving PUVA, though the differences were not statistically 
significant. Based on the available evidence and clinical guidelines, PUVA may be considered in 
patients with vitiligo who have not responded adequately to conservative therapy. The evidence is 
sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.

Vitiligo Working Group 
The Vitiligo Working Group is supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal 
and Skin Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. In 2017, the group published guidelines 
on current and emerging treatments for vitiligo.15, The Working Group indicated that psoralen plus 
ultraviolet A (PUVA) has largely been replaced by NB- UVB, but that “PUVA may be considered 
in patients with darker Fitzpatrick skin phototypes or those with treatment-resistant vitiligo (level I 
evidence).” The Working Group also stated that “Targeted phototherapy (excimer lasers and excimer 
lamps) can be considered when <10% of body surface area is affected (level II evidence).”
