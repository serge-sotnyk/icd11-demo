2.01.017 Allergy Immunotherapy
         Original MPC Approval:  04/01/98
         Last Review:   09/01/2021
         Last Revision: 09/01/2021
Description
Immunotherapy involves regular injections of an offending allergen over a period of months, with the goal of increasing 
immunity and reducing symptoms.  It begins with low doses to prevent untoward reactions, with gradually increasing 
doses injected once or twice a week as immunity to the antigen develops.  After the maintenance dose is achieved, the 
interval between injections may range between two and six weeks.  Immunotherapy may be administered continuously 
for several years. 
Policy
Immunotherapy is considered medically necessary in patients with demonstrated hypersensitivity that cannot be 
managed by medications or avoidance.  Injections of airborne (for example; severe seasonal allergic rhinitis or 
conjunctivitis) or insect venom (Hymenoptera) allergens should be prepared for the patient individually.  
Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) using Oralair®, Grastek®, or Ragwitek® may be considered medically necessary, 
when used according to FDA labelling, for the treatment of pollen-induced allergic rhinitis when the following conditions 
are met:
• The member has a history of rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms related to grass or short ragweed pollen 
exposure; and
• The member has a documented positive pollen-specific skin test or pollen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) test; 
and
• The symptoms are not adequately controlled by appropriate pharmacotherapy.
The following methods of immunotherapy are considered experimental/investigational, as they do not meet TEC 
criteria # 2-5.
• Provocative and neutralization therapy for food allergies, using intradermal and subcutaneous routes (e.g., ALCAT, 
SAGE),
• Urine autoinjections (autogenous urine immunization); and
•Rinkel, or serial dilution endpoint titration therapy, except when done with serial endpoint testing as defined in 
policy on SET (see Allergy Testing, Policy 2.01.023). This immunotherapy uses therapeutic dose determined by 
skin endpoint titration as treatment. Generally, the dosage determined by this method is approximately 1000 times 
weaker than dosages calculated by more conventional methods and has been shown to be no more effective than 
placebo for relieving symptoms or for producing immunologic effect.  Sublingual immunotherapy using Odactra® may be considered medically necessary when used in accordance with 
FDA labeling, for the treatment of house dust mite-induced allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis when the following 
criterion are met: 
• Patient is 18 to 65 years of age.
• Patient has a history of rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms related to dust mite exposure.
• Patient has a documented positive house dust mite (HDM) specific skin test or house dust mite specific 
immunoglobulin E test. 
oAllergy must be confirmed by positive skin test, using licensed house dust mite allergen extracts or in vitro 
testing for house dust mite specific immunoglobulin E antibodies to the Dermatophagoides farinae and 
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus species.
• Patient’s symptoms are not adequately controlled by appropriate pharmacotherapy.
Sublingual immunotherapy (Odactra®) as a technique of allergy immunotherapy is considered 
experimental/investigational for all other indications.
Policy Guidelines
Rationale:
A review of peer-reviewed literature does not support the use of allergy immunotherapy for conditions other than those 
medically necessary indications listed in the Policy section of this document.
Update 2008:
A search of the peer-reviewed literature was performed from August 2006 through August 2008.  Despite extensive 
studies and ongoing clinical trials in regard to sublingual immunotherapy, there is no allergy extract approved for SLIT 
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States.  There was a scarcity of peer-reviewed literature 
for provocative and neutralization therapy, urine autoinjections or serial dilution endpoint titration therapy; therefore, 
the policy statements remain unchanged.
Update 2010:
A search of the peer reviewed literature was performed from September 2008 through November 2010.  Findings in 
the literature do not change the medically necessary indications as listed in the policy. 
No allergy extracts for sublingual immunotherapy are currently cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. 
Update 2013:
A search of the peer-reviewed literature was performed from December 2010 through January 2013.  The findings in 
the literature do not support any change in the policy regarding immunotherapy treatment of allergy disorders. There 
are no FDA approved formulations for oral immunotherapy or SLIT at this time.
Update 2015:
A search of the peer-reviewed literature was performed from February 2013 through April 2015.  In April 2014, the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first sublingual allergen extract tablets for treatment of pollen-
induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis.  On April 1, 2014, the FDA approved Oralair® allergen extract for 
patients 10-65 years of age for the treatment of allergies to Kentucky Blue Grass, Orchard, Perennial Rye, Sweet 
Vernal, and Timothy grasses.  On April 11, 2014, the FDA approved Grastek® for patients 5-65 years of age with 
allergies to Timothy grass pollen.  On April 17, 2014, the FDA approved Ragwitek® for patients 18-65 years of age with 
allergies to ragweed pollen.  In March 2013, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality published a comparative 
effectiveness review comparing the effectiveness and safety of subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual 
immunotherapy with other therapies for the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma.  The agency performed 
a meta-analysis of 142 randomized controlled studies and found the overall body of evidence consistently provides 
moderate to high support for the effectiveness and safety of both subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy for the 
treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma. Update 2017:
A search of the peer-reviewed literature was performed from May 2015 through April 2017.  Findings in the literature 
do not support any change in the medically necessary or experimental / investigational indications listed in the policy.  
Update 2019:
A search of the peer-reviewed literature was performed from the period of May 2017 through June 2019.  Findings in 
the recent literature revealed a new tablet for sublingual administration.  On March 1, 2017, the FDA approved Odactra® 
(Merck), as the first allergen extract for the treatment of house dust mite (HDM) (Dermatophagoides farinae and 
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis. The FDA authorizes use for 
patients 18 through 65 years of age. The first dose of Odactra® must be administered in a healthcare setting under the 
supervision of a physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases.
Odactra®’s safety and efficacy were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial with a total of 1482 
participants.  Subjects ages ranged from 12 years and older with house dust mite-induced allergic rhinitis with or without 
conjunctivitis, and with or without asthma.  Participants were treated with Odactra® or a placebo tablet administered 
once per day for a total of 52 weeks.  Improvement in the average Total Combined Rhinitis Score after treatment, 
compared with placebo, was 17% (95% CI, 10% to 25%). This primary efficacy end point, which integrated symptoms 
and medication use, met prespecified targets for clinical significance. Furthermore, participants demonstrated 
improvement in average conjunctivitis scores and with improvement over placebo of 33% (95% CI, 19% to 47%). Seven 
patients were treated with epinephrine for adverse events; 1 patient experienced severe “throat tightness” after the first 
dose. Adverse events were reported as mild to moderate in severity.  The most common events documented were 
mouth and throat irritation, swelling of lips, and itching in the ear. No treatment-related serious adverse events were 
reported. 
Update 2021:
A search of the peer-reviewed literature was performed from the period of July 2019 through June 2021. Findings in 
the recent literature do not support any change in the medically necessary or experimental / investigational indications 
listed in the policy.  
Benefit Applications
NOTE:  For FEP business check the member's contract for benefits.
 
Provider Guidelines
The CPT® codes for allergen immunotherapy are specific to parenteral administration and should not be used for 
sublingual immunotherapy.  The unlisted code should be used when reporting sublingual immunotherapy. 
When reporting professional services for the supervision of preparation and provision of antigens for allergen 
immunotherapy for a specific treatment set, the calculated doses should be based on the actual number of doses 
prospectively planned to be administered on a given dose schedule.  A dose is the amount of antigen(s) in a single 
injection from a single or multiple dose vial (that is, one injection equals one dose). The professional services for the 
immunotherapy are reported separately at the time the injection is administered.
NOTE:  Check individual contract for benefits and for specific preauthorization requirements.
