Services Are Considered Investigational  
Coverage is not available for investigational medical treatments or procedures, drugs, devices or 
biological products.  
 
Based on review of available data, the Company considers spinal manipulation (and manipulation of 
other joints, e.g., hip joint, performed during the procedure) with the patient under anesthesia, spinal 
manipulation under joint anesthesia, and spinal manipulation after epidural anesthesia and 
corticosteroid injection for treatment of chronic spinal (cranial, cervical, thoracic, lumbar) pain and 
chronic sacroiliac and pelvic pain to be investigational.*  
 
Based on review of available data, the Company considers spinal manipulation and manipulation of 
other joints under anesthesia involving serial treatment sessions to be investigational.*  
 
Based on review of available data, the Company considers manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) 
involving multiple body joints for treatment of chronic pain to be investigational.*  
 
Note: This policy does not address manipulation under anesthesia for fractures, completely 
dislocated joints, adhesive capsulitis (e.g., frozen shoulder), and/or fibrosis of a joint that may occur 
following total joint replacement 
 
Background/Overview  
Manipulation Under Anesthesia 
Manipulation is intended to break up fibrous and scar tissue to relieve pain and improve range of 
motion. Anesthesia or sedation is used to reduce pain, spasm, and reflex muscle guarding that may 
interfere with the delivery of therapies and to allow the therapist to break up joint and soft tissue 
adhesions with less force than would be required to overcome patient resistance or apprehension. 
Manipulation under anesthesia is generally performed with an anesthesiologist in attendance. 
Manipulation under anesthesia is an accepted treatment for isolated joint conditions, such as

arthrofibrosis of the knee and adhesive capsulitis. It is also used to reduce fractures (eg, vertebral, 
long bones) and dislocations. 
 
Manipulation under anesthesia has been proposed as a treatment modality for acute and chronic pain 
conditions, particularly of the spine, when standard care, including manipulation, and other 
conservative measures have failed. Manipulation under anesthesia of the spine has been used in 
various forms since the 1930s. Complications from general anesthesia and forceful long-lever, high-
amplitude nonspecific manipulation procedures led to decreased use of the procedure in favor of other 
therapies. Manipulation under anesthesia was modified and revived in the 1990s. This revival has 
been attributed to increased interest in spinal manipulative therapy and the advent of safer, shorter-
acting anesthesia agents used for conscious sedation. 
 
Manipulation Under Anesthesia Administration 
Manipulation under anesthesia of the spine is described as follows: after sedation, a series of 
mobilization, stretching, and traction procedures to the spine and lower extremities are performed 
and may include passive stretching of the gluteal and hamstring muscles with straight-leg raise, hip 
capsule stretching and mobilization, lumbosacral traction, and stretching of the lateral abdominal and 
paraspinal muscles. After the stretching and traction procedures, spinal manipulative therapy is 
delivered with high-velocity, short-amplitude thrust applied to a spinous process by hand, while the 
upper torso and lower extremities are stabilized. Spinal manipulative therapy may also be applied to 
the thoracolumbar or cervical area when necessary to address low back pain. 
 
Manipulation under anesthesia takes 15 to 20 minutes, and after recovery from anesthesia, the patient 
is discharged with instructions to remain active and use heat or ice for short-term analgesic control. 
Some practitioners recommend performing the procedure on 3 or more consecutive days for best 
results. Care after manipulation under anesthesia may include 4 to 8 weeks of active rehabilitation 
with manual therapy, including spinal manipulative therapy and other modalities. Manipulation has 
also been performed after injection of local anesthetic into lumbar zygapophyseal (facet) and/or 
sacroiliac joints under fluoroscopic guidance (manipulation under joint anesthesia/analgesia) and 
after epidural injection of corticosteroid and local anesthetic (manipulation postepidural injection). 
Spinal manipulation under anesthesia has also been combined with other joint manipulation during 
multiple sessions. Together, these therapies may be referred to as medicine-assisted manipulation.

This review does not address manipulation under anesthesia  for fractures, completely dislocated 
joints, adhesive capsulitis (eg, frozen shoulder), and/or fibrosis of a joint that may occur following 
total joint replacement.  
 
FDA or Other Governmental Regulatory Approval  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Manipulative procedures are not subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
 
Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer-reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other plan 
medical policies, and accredited national guidelines. 
 
Manipulation under anesthesia consists of a series of mobilization, stretching, and traction procedures 
performed while the patient is sedated (usually with general anesthesia or moderate sedation). 
 
Summary of Evidence 
For individuals who have chronic spinal, sacroiliac, or pelvic pain who receive manipulation under 
anesthesia, the evidence includes case series, observational studies, and nonrandomized comparative 
studies. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, functional outcomes, quality of life, and treatment-related 
morbidity. Scientific evidence on spinal manipulation under anesthesia, spinal manipulation with 
joint anesthesia, and spinal manipulation after epidural anesthesia and corticosteroid injection is very 
limited. No randomized controlled trials have been identified. Evidence on the efficacy of 
manipulation under anesthesia over several sessions or for multiple joints is also lacking. The 
evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health 
outcome.

Supplemental Information  
Clinical Input From Physician Specialty Societies and Academic Medical Centers 
While the various physician specialty societies and academic medical centers may collaborate with 
and make recommendations during this process, through the provision of appropriate reviewers, input 
received does not represent an endorsement or position statement by the physician specialty societies 
or academic medical centers, unless otherwise noted. 
 
2009 Input 
Clinical input was sought to help determine whether the use of manipulation under anesthesia for 
individuals with chronic spinal and pelvic pain would provide a clinically meaningful improvement 
in net health outcome and whether the use is consistent with generally accepted medical practice. In 
response to requests, input was received from 2 physician specialty societies and 4 academic medical 
centers while this policy was under review. Input from the 7 reviewers agreed that manipulation under 
anesthesia for chronic spinal and pelvic pain is investigational. 
 
Practice Guidelines and Position Statements 
Guidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in ‘Supplemental Information' if 
they were issued by, or jointly by, a US professional society, an international society with US 
representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to 
guidelines that are informed by a systematic review, include strength of evidence ratings, and include 
a description of management of conflict of interest. 
 
American Association of Manipulation Under Anesthesia Providers 
In 2014, The American Association of Manipulation Under Anesthesia Providers published 
consensus-based guidelines for the practice and performance of manipulation under anesthesia.12, The 
guidelines included patient selection criteria (see below), establishing medical necessity, frequency 
and follow-up procedures, parameters for determining manipulation under anesthesia progress, 
general post-manipulation under anesthesia therapy, and safety. The guidelines recommended 3 
consecutive days of treatment, based on the premise that serial procedures allow a gentler yet effective 
treatment plan with better control of biomechanical force. The guidelines also recommended follow-
up therapy without anesthesia over 8 weeks after manipulation under anesthesia that included all 
fibrosis release and manipulative procedures performed during the manipulation under anesthesia 
procedure to help prevent re-adhesion.

Patient selection criteria include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• "The patient has undergone an adequate trial of appropriate care...and continues to experience 
intractable pain, interference to activities of daily living, and/or biomecha nical dysfunction. ” 
• "Sufficient care has been rendered prior to recommending manipulation under anesthesia. A 
sufficient time period is usually considered a minimum of 4 to 8 weeks, but exceptions may 
apply depending on the patient's individual needs.... ” 
• "Physical medicine procedures have been utilized in a clinical setting during the 6 to 8 week 
period prior to recommending manipulation under anesthesia. ” 
• "Diagnosed conditions must fall within the recognized categories of conditions responsive to 
manipula tion under anesthesia. The following disorders are classified as acceptable conditions 
for utilization of manipulation under anesthesia: ” 
1. "Patients for whom manipulation of the spine or other articulations is the treatment of 
choice; however, the patient's  pain threshold inhibits the effectiveness of conservative 
manipulation. ” 
2. "Patients for whom manipulation of the spine or other articulations is the treatment of 
choice; however, due to the extent of the injury mechanism, conservative manipulation 
has been  minimally effective...and a greater degree of movement of the affected 
joint(s) is needed to obtain patient progress. ” 
3. "Patients for whom manipulation of the spine or other articulations is the treatment of 
choice by the doctor; however due to the chronic ity of the problem, and/or the fibrous 
tissue adhesions present, in -office manipulation has been incomplete and the plateau 
in the patient's improvement is unsatisfactory. ” 
4. "When the patient is considered for surgical intervention, manipulation under 
anest hesia is an alternative and/or an interim treatment and may be used as a 
therapeutic and/or diagnostic tool in the overall consideration of the patient's 
condition. ” 
5. "When there are no better treatment options available for the patient in the opinions 
of the treating doctor and patient."
