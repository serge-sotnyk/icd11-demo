Introduction  
Idiopathic means “unknown cause.” Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lung (pulmonary) 
condition in which the lungs become scarred (fibrosis). Usually only one person in a family 
develops IPF. In a very small number of cases, IPF can develop in family  members. When this 
happens, it’s called familial pulmonary fibrosis.  
Because of the scar tissue, the lungs are not able to move  oxygen into the bloodstream very 
well. The usual symptoms are a shortness of breath and a dry cough. It’s a progressive condit ion, 
meaning it gets worse over time. IPF usually affects people between 50 and 70 years old. There is no cure for IPF , but certain drugs can  slow the progression to help maintain breathing 
capacity. This policy describes when medications for IPF  and other  diseases that cause fibrosis of 
the lungs  may be considered medically necessary.

ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Criteria for the D iagnosis o f Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis  
1. IPF is defined as a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of 
unknown cause, occurring primarily in older adults, limited to the lungs, and associated with the histopathologic and/or radiologic pattern of UIP (Usual Interstitial Pneumonia)  
2. The diagnosis of IPF requires:  
a. Exclusion of other known causes of interstitial lung disease (ILD) ( e.g., domestic and 
occupational environmental exposures, connective tissue disease, and drug toxicity)  
b. The presence of a UIP pattern on high -resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in 
individuals not subjected to surgical lung biopsy (Biopsy may not be feasible in certain 
individuals  due to their risk for the procedu re) 
c. Specific combinations of HRCT and surgical lung biopsy pattern in individuals  subjected to 
surgical lung biopsy  
3. The accuracy of the diagnosis of IPF increases with multidisciplinary discussion between 
pulmonologists, radiologists, and pathologists experienced in the diagnosis of ILD

Evidence Review   
 
Ofev® (nintedanib)  
Ofev® (nintedanib) is a tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor (TKI) indicated for the treatment of 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). A Phase III replicate trial (INPULSIS -1 and INPULSIS -2) 
demonstrated the efficacy of nintedanib verses placebo in individual s with idio pathic pulmonary 
fibrosis. The trial was conducted for 52 weeks and enrolled 1066 individuals  who were 
diagnosed with IPF within the previous five years. Criteria for eligibility included having a FVC 
greater than 50% of the predicted value, a diff usion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide 
(DLCO) between 30 – 79% of the predicted value, and a chest high resolution computed 
tomography (HRCT) within the last twelve months. The primary outcome for both trials was the annual rate of decline in FVC ( milliliters/year). Secondary outcomes were the time to the first 
acute exacerbation and change from baseline score on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) - a subjective measuring tool for quality of life.  
Individuals  receiving ninteda nib 150mg BID as monotherapy achieved a significant decrease in 
annual FVC decline when compared to placebo at a reduction of 125.5ml/year (95% CI, 77.7 - 
172.8, p< 0.001) in INPULSIS - 1 and 93.7ml/year (95% CI, 44.8 - 142.7, p< 0.001) in INPULSIS - 2. 
While IMPULSIS - 1 did not show significant reduction in the time until first exacerbation, 
IMPULSIS -2 did demonstrate some significant decrease with a hazard ratio of 0.38 (95%Ci, 0.19 - 
0.77, p= 0.005). When comparing changes in SGRQ scores from baseline, there  were decreases 
in both trials indicating an improvement in quality of life (QOL). However, once again only 
IMPULSIS - 2 demonstrated significance at - 2.69 (95% CI, -4.95 to - 0.43; p= 0.02).  
The TOMORROW Phase II trial was similar in design and primary outc omes. As opposed to the 
phase III trials that did demonstrate efficacy, the phase II trial did not show significance in regard 
to decreased annual FVC decline when compared to placebo. However, it was noted that with nintedanib 150mg twice daily, there was  a trend towards a general reduction in annual FVC 
decline at 68.4% (p= 0.06). This prompted the current therapeutic dose recommended today of Page | 10  of 19  ∞ 150mg BID with a lower dose of 100mg showing some efficacy with less potential for adverse 
events. Secondary outc omes of this trial were incidences of acute exacerbations per 100 
individual- years and difference in the mean SGRQ score from baseline. The number of acute 
exacerbations was significantly lower in the nintedanib group compared to placebo with a relative risk of 0.16 (95% CI, 0.03- 0.70; p= 0.02). Similar to phase III trials, there was a significant 
decrease in the SGRQ score from baseline of 0.66 (p= 0.007).  
The most common adverse events noted in the registrational clinical trials were gastrointestinal (GI) in nature. In the phase II trials, individuals  receiving nintedanib 150mg BID experienced at 
least one episode of diarrhea (55%), nausea (23%), and vomiting (13%) during the duration of 
the study and these events were responsible for most of the discontinuations in the treatment 
group. Individuals  participating in IMPULSIS - 1 and -2 had similar adverse events, with diarrhea 
(61.5% and 63%) and nausea (23% and 26%) being the most prominent, and discontinuations of 
4.5% and 4.3% in ea ch trial, respectively.  
Nintedanib has also been associated with elevated liver enzymes in both pha se II and III trials. 
Some individuals  experienced clinically significant increase (three times the upper limit of 
normal) in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) . Because 
nintedanib is metabolized partially by the liver, its use should be monitored for  mild liver 
impairment and avoided in those with moderate to severe impairment. Liver enzymes should be monitored at base line, prior to initiating nintedanib therapy and monitored periodically 
afterwards. Dose reduction and/or discontinuation of nintedanib resulted in a normalization of 
liver enzymes with no chronic liver impairment.  
Nintedanib has not been studied in indiv iduals  with severe renal and moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh score B or C). Currently there are no guidelines for the treatment of individuals  with severe renal impairment, but mild to moderate renal insufficiencies do not 
require any dose adjustments as less than 1% of the starting dose is excreted by the kidneys. 
Nintedanib should not be recommended for individuals  with moderate  to severe hepatic 
impairment.  
 
Esbriet® (pirfenidone)  
Esbriet® (pirfenidone)  is a novel antifibrotic agent that has been recently approved for the 
treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) after being previously removed from the market 
due to the lack of efficacy data. Since its removal, three more phase III trials were conducted: 
CAPACITY 004 & 006 and ASCEND. These were double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, international and multi- center trials. Treatment consisted of pirfenidone 2403mg/daily Page | 11  of 19  ∞ compared to placebo. In the CAPACITY 004 trial, a lower 1197mg/day dose was used to examine 
any dose response relationship. Pirfenidone has shown mixed results in its efficacy, which is 
defined as a decrease in disease progression. The usual measurement is the change in FVC over 
time. In the three studies, treatment duration either lasted between 52 and 72 weeks. Enrolled 
individuals  had either a clinical or radiographic diagnosis of IPF with other causes ruled out. 
Baseline characteristics were gene rally balanced amongst all groups. The population age was 
between 40 – 80 years old with the mean age of 67 years. A majority of the individuals  were 
white males with some form of smoking history. The mean baseline FVC was 72% across all treatment  groups.  
Both CAPACITY 004 and ASCEND showed significant results in regard to  percent predicted FVC 
after the trial period from baseline. CAPACITY 004 had an absolute mean FVC difference of 4.4% between pirfenidone 2403mg daily versus placebo after 72 weeks. ASCEND demonstrated an absolute mean FVC difference of 4.8% between pirfenidone 2403mg daily and placebo after 72 
weeks. The impact of the 0.4% difference between the two trials is not known. CAPACITY 006 
was the only trial out of the three that did no t meet  its primary endpoint. There was no 
association between differences in predicted FVC and certain secondary outcomes. These include but are not limited to the University of California at San Diego Shortness of Breath 
Questionnaire (SOBQ) for dyspnea, World Health Organization Quality of Life score, and 
mortality. Secondary outcomes in all three trials were noted to be exploratory and not make a claim for efficacy in the prescribing information.  
The most common adverse effects noticed in all three tria ls were nausea (36%) and rash (30%). 
The mean exposure time to pirfenidone across all three trials was 62 weeks with the maximum 
duration being 118 weeks. Longer term safety risks have yet to be established. At the daily recommended dose of 2403mg, there w ere slightly higher discontinuations in treatment due to 
adverse effects than compared with placebo (15% vs. 10%).
1,2 
In three of the Phase III trials, there were higher incidences of photosensitivity reactions usually within the first 6 months of initiating treatment.  
Elevated liver enzymes have also been associated with pirfenidone. Across the three phase III trials, there were higher incidences of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) elevations ( 3 times the upper limit of n ormal [ULN]) in pirfenidone 
treatment versus placebo (3.7% vs. 0.8%). These effects were reversible with dose reduction or 
discontinuation of the treatment. No further complications or liver failure were noted.  
In a trial comparing the pharmacokinetics of  pirfenidone in individuals  with normal renal 
function to either mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, there was an increase in overall 
systemic exposure of 1.4, 1.5, and 1.2 fold, respectively. Pirfenidone should be used with caution Page | 12  of 19  ∞ in individuals  that have mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, and adverse effects should 
be monitored closely with therapeutic adjustments , if needed.  
Phase III data has shown that while the side effect profile of pirfenidone can vary to be 
gastrointestinal (GI) or dermatologic in nature, the symptoms can be treated with supportive therapy or avoidance of prolonged sun exposure and other concomitant photosensitive drugs.  
 
Actemra® (tocilizumab)  
Actemra® (tocilizumab) is an interleukin -6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist indicated for treatment of 
multiple inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis, and giant cell arteritis. Early studies had  also suggested that inhibition of IL -6 might 
reduce skin fib rosis in individuals  with systemic sclerosis and preserve lung function.  
The clinical efficacy of tocilizumab  was assessed in a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled  study in individuals  with SSc (Study WA29767).  A phase 2/3 
multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled  study in individuals  with SSc (Study 
WA27788) provided supportive information. Study WA29767 (NCT02453256) enrolled adult individuals  with SSc defined by the 2013 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for SSc, with onset of 
disease (first non -Raynaud symptom) of ≤ 5 years, modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) of ≥ 10 
and ≤ 35 at screening, elevated inflammatory markers (or platelets), and active disease based on 
at least one of the following: disease duration ≤ 18 months, increase in mRSS ≥ 3 units over 6 
months, involvement of one new body area and an increase in mRSS of ≥ 2 over 6 months, or 
involvement of two new body areas within the previous 6 months, or presence of at least one tendon friction rub. Study WA27788 (NCT01532869) enrolled adult individuals with SSc with 
onset of disease ≤ 5 years, mRSS of ≥ 15 and ≤ 40 at screening, active disease, and elevated 
inflammatory markers or platelets. Individuals  in both studies were not permitted to use biologic 
agents (such as TNF antagonists), alkylating agents,  or cyclophosphamide.  
In Study WA29767, 212 individuals  were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive weekly SC 
injections of 162 mg of tocilizumab  or placebo during the 48 -week, double -blinded, placebo -
controlled  period. Rescue treatment was allowed d uring the treatment period after 16 weeks for 
>10% percent predicted FVC (ppFVC) decline or after 24 weeks for worsening skin fibrosis. The 
primary efficacy endpoint was changed  from baseline at Week 48 in mRSS. Change from 
baseline in FVC at Week 48 was a key secondary endpoint.  
In the overall population of Study WA29767, there was not a statistically significant difference in the mean change from baseline to Week 48 in mRSS (primary endpoint) in individuals  receiving Page | 13  of 19  ∞ tocilizumab  compared to placebo (difference: - 1.73; 95% CI: -3.78, 0.32). There also was not a 
statistically significant effect on the primary endpoint of mRSS in Study WA27788.  
In the overall population of Study WA29767, individuals  treated with tocilizumab , as compared 
to pla cebo treated individuals , were observed to have less decline from baseline in ppFVC and 
observed FVC at 48 weeks. FVC results from Study WA27788 were similar.  
Of the 212 individuals  who were randomized in Study WA29767, 68 individuals  (65%) in the 
tocilizumab  arm and 68 individuals  (64%) in the placebo arm had SSc -ILD at baseline, as 
confirmed by a visual read of high resolution computed tomography  (HRCT) by blinded thoracic 
radiologists. The mean ppFVC at baseline for indiv iduals  with SSc -ILD identified by HRCT was 
79.6% (median 80.5%). Post -hoc analyses were performed to evaluate results  
within the subgroups of individuals  with and without SSc -ILD. 
The ppFVC and observed FVC results in the overall population  were primarily driven by results in 
the SSc -ILD subgroup. In the SSc -ILD subgroup, the differences in mean changes from baseline 
to Week 48 for tocilizumab , as compared to placebo, were 6.47% and 241 mL for ppFVC and 
observed FVC, respectively.  
The result s of the key FVC secondary endpoints from Study WA29767 support a conclusion of 
effectiveness of tocilizumab  in reducing the rate of progressive loss of lung function in the study 
population. However, in settings where a trial does not provide evidence of an effect on the 
primary endpoint, the estimated magnitude of effect on other endpoints should be interpreted 
with caution, and comparisons to results of other products and studies may be misleading.  
The most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least  5%) reported with tocilizumab  are 
upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension, increased ALT, injection site reactions.  
 
Tyvaso® (treprostinil)  Inhalation Solution and Tyvaso DPI ™ (treprostinil)  
Tyvaso® (treprostinil) is a prostacyclin mimetic  indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial

randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter study that enrolled 326 individuals  
with PH -ILD. Enrolled study individ uals predominately had etiologies of idiopathic interstitial 
pneumonia (45%) inclusive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, combined pulmonary fibrosis  and Page | 14  of 19  ∞ emphysema (25%), and WHO Group 3 connective tissue disease (22%). The mean baseline 
6MWD  was 2 60 meters.  
Individuals  in the INCREASE study were randomized (1:1) to either placebo or Tyvaso in 4 daily 
treatment  sessions with a target dose of 9 breaths (54 mcg) per session and a maximum dose of 
12 breaths  (72 mcg) per session over the course of the 16 -week study. Approximately 75% of 
individuals  randomized  to Tyvaso titrated up to a dose of 9 breaths, 4 times daily or greater, 
with 48% of individuals  randomized to  Tyvaso reaching a dose of 12 breaths, 4 times daily 
during the s tudy.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in 6MWD measured at peak exposure (between 10 and  60 minutes after dosing) from baseline to Week 16. Individuals  receiving Tyvaso had a 
placebo -corrected  median change from baseline in peak 6MWD of  21 meters at Week 16 
(p=0.004) using Hodges -Lehmann estimate.  The treatment effect on 6MWD at Week 16 was 
consistent for various subgroups, including etiology of PH -ILD, disease severity, age, sex, 
baseline hemodynamics, and dose.  
Time to clinical worseni ng in the INCREASE study was defined as the time of randomization until 
1 of the following criteria were met: hospitalization due to a cardiopulmonary indication, decrease in 6MWD >15% from baseline directly related to PH -ILD at 2 consecutive visits and at  
least 24 hours apart, death (all causes), or lung transplantation. Treatment with Tyvaso in individuals  with PH -ILD resulted in numerically fewer hospitalizations. The numbers of reported 
deaths were the same for both treatment groups. Overall, tr eatment with Tyvaso demonstrated 
a statistically significant increase in the time to first clinical worsening event (log -rank test 
p=0.041), and a 39% overall reduction in the risk of a clinical worsening event (HR=0.61 [95% CI; 0.40, 0.92]).  
The most comm on adverse reactions (incidenc e ≥ 4%) reported with Tyvaso  are cough, 
headache, nausea, dizziness, flushing, throat irritation, pharyngolaryngeal pain, diarrhea, and syncope.  
In a 3 -week, open -label, single -sequence, safety and tolerability study (BREEZE) conducted in 51 
individuals  on stable doses of Tyvaso Inhalation Solution who switched to a corresponding dose 
of Tyvaso DPI, the most commonly reported adverse events  on Tyvaso DPI during the 3 -week 
treatment phase included cough (35.3%), headache (15.7%), dyspnea (7.8%), and nausea (5.9%). Individual  tolerability, as assessed by incidence of new adverse events following transition to 
Tyvaso DPI, was consistent with the expected known safety profile of Tyvaso Inhalation Solution.
