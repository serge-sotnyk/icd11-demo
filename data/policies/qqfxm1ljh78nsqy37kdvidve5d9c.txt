DRUG NAME  Acthar Gel (repository corticotropin 
injection)  
BILLING CODE  J0800  
BENEFIT TYPE  Medical  
STATUS  Prior Authorization Required  
 
Acthar Gel is a corticotropin initially approved by the FDA in 1952. It is indicated as monotherapy for the 
treatment of infantile spasms in infants and children under 2 years of age and for the treatment of 
exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults . The mechanism of action of Acthar Gel in the treatment of 
infantile spasms is unknown. Acthar Gel and endogenous ACTH stimulate the adrenal cortex to secrete 
cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, and a number of weakly androgenic substances. Prolonged 
admi nistration of large doses of Acthar Gel induces hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex and 
continuous high output of cortisol, corticosterone and weak androgens. The release of endogenous ACTH is 
under the influence of the nervous system via the regulatory hormone released from the hypothalamus and 
by a negative corticosteroid feedback mechanism. Elevated plasma cortisol suppresses ACTH release. 
Acthar Gel is also reported to bind to melanocortin receptors. The trophic effects of endogenous ACTH and 
Acthar Gel on the adrenal cortex are not well understood beyond the fact that they appear to be mediated by 
cyclic AMP. A recent review found repository corticotropin injection was not superior to corticosteroids for 
treating relapses of MS.  
 
Acthar Gel (repository corticotropin injection) will be considered for coverage when the 
following criteria are met:  
 
Infantile Spasms (West syndrome, X -linked infantile spasms syndrome)

3. Member has documented diagnosis of infantile spasms in chart notes; AND  
4. Member’s body surface area (BSA, m2) or hei ght and weight have been provided to determine the 
appropriate dosage.  
5. Medication is used as monotherapy; AND  
6. Dosage allowed/Quanity limit:  The recommended regimen is a maximum daily dose of 150 U/m2
