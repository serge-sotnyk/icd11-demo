BackAutologous Chondrocyte Implantation for Focal Articular Cartilage Lesions
Policy Number: MP-156
Latest Review Date: April 2023
Category:  Surgery                                                                 
Policy Grade:  A
POLICY:
Autologous chondrocyte implantation may be considered medically necessary for the treatment of disabling full-thickness articular
cartilage defects of the knee caused by acute or repetitive trauma, when all of the following criteria are met:
The patient is skeletally mature with documented closure of growth plates and not considered an appropriate candidate for
total knee arthroplasty or other reconstructive knee surgery (e.g., age greater than 15 and less than 55 years); AND
Focal, full-thickness (grade III or IV) unipolar lesions of the patella or the weight-bearing surface of the femoral condyles or
trochlea at least 1.5 cm
 in size; AND
Documented minimal to absent degenerative changes in the surrounding articular cartilage (Outerbridge grade II or less), and
normal-appearing hyaline cartilage surrounding the border of the defect; AND
Normal knee biomechanics or alignment and stability achieved concurrently with autologous chondrocyte implantation.
Autologous chondrocyte implantation for all other joints, including talar, and any indications other than those listed above
is considered investigational.
Prophylactic harvesting of cells during other reconstructive or reparative procedures for possible future implantation is considered
not medically necessary.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE OR SERVICE:
A variety of procedures are being developed to resurface articular cartilage defects. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI)
involves harvesting chondrocytes from healthy tissue, expanding the cells in vitro, and implanting the expanded cells into the
chondral defect under a periosteal or fibrin patch. Second- and third- generation techniques include combinations of autologous
chondrocytes, scaffolds, and growth factors. This procedure may be performed at the same time as other surgical procedures such
as repair of tendons or ligaments, osteotomies for realignment of a joint, or meniscal allograft transplantation.
Damaged articular cartilage typically fails to heal on its own and can be associated with pain, loss of function, and disability, and may
lead to debilitating osteoarthritis over time.  These manifestations can severely impair an individual’s activities of daily living and
adversely affect the quality of life. 
Conventional treatment options include debridement, subchondral drilling, microfracture, and abrasion arthroplasty. Debridement
involves the removal of synovial membrane, osteophytes, loose articular debris, and diseased cartilage and is capable of producing
symptomatic relief. Subchondral drilling, microfracture, and abrasion arthroplasty attempt to restore the articular surface by
inducing the growth of fibrocartilage into the chondral defect. Compared with the original hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage has less
capability to withstand shock or shearing force and can degenerate over time, often resulting in the return of clinical symptoms.
Osteochondral grafts and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) attempt to regenerate hyaline-like cartilage and thereby
restore durable function. Osteochondral grafts for the treatment of articular cartilage defects are discussed in Medical Policy #248,
Autografts and Allografts in the Treatment of Focal Articular Cartilage Lesions.
With ACI, a region of healthy articular cartilage is identified and biopsied through arthroscopy. The tissue is sent to a facility licensed
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) where it is minced and enzymatically digested, and the chondrocytes are separated
by filtration. The isolated chondrocytes are cultured for 11 to 21 days to expand the cell population, tested, and then shipped back
for implantation. With the patient under general anesthesia, an arthrotomy is performed, and the chondral lesion is excised up to
the normal surrounding cartilage. Methods to improve the first-generation ACI procedure have been developed, including the use of
a scaffold or matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) composed of biocompatible carbohydrates, protein
polymers, or synthetics. The only FDA-approved MACI product to date is supplied in a sheet, which is cut to size and fixed with fibrin
glue. This procedure is considered technically easier and less time consuming than the first-generation technique, which required
suturing of a periosteal or collagen patch and injection of chondrocytes under the patch.
Desired features of articular cartilage repair procedures are the ability (1) to be implanted easily, (2) to reduce surgical morbidity, (3)
not to require harvesting of other tissues, (4) to enhance cell proliferation and maturation, (5) to maintain the phenotype, and (6) to
integrate with the surrounding articular tissue. In addition to the potential to improve the formation and distribution of hyaline
cartilage, use of a scaffold with MACI eliminates the need for harvesting and suture of a periosteal or collagen patch. A scaffold
without cells may also support chondrocyte growth.
KEY POINTS:
The most recent literature update was performed through February 16, 2023.
Summary of Evidence
For individuals who have focal articular cartilage lesion(s) of the weight-bearing surface of the femoral condyles, trochlea, or patella
who receive ACI, the evidence includes systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. Relevant
2outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, morbid events, functional outcomes, and quality of life. There is a large body of
evidence on ACI for the treatment of focal articular cartilage lesions of the knee. For large lesions, ACI results in better outcomes
than microfracture, particularly in the long term. In addition, there is a limit to the size of lesions that can be treated with
osteochondral autograft transfer, due to a limit on the number of osteochondral cores that can be safely harvested. As a result, ACI
has become the established treatment for large articular cartilage lesions in the knee. In 2017, first-generation ACI with a collagen
cover was phased out and replaced with an ACI preparation that seeds the chondrocytes onto a bioresorbable collagen sponge.
Although the implantation procedure for this second-generation ACI is less technically demanding, studies to date have not shown
improved outcomes compared with first-generation ACI. Some evidence has suggested an increase in hypertrophy (overgrowth) of
the new implant that may exceed that of the collagen membrane covered implant. Long-term studies with a larger number of
patients will be needed to determine whether this hypertrophy impacts graft survival. Based on mid-term outcomes that
approximate those of first-generation ACI and the lack of alternatives, secondgeneration ACI may be considered an option for large
disabling full-thickness cartilage lesions of the knee. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a
meaningful improvement in the net health outcome.
For individuals who have focal articular cartilage lesions of joints other than the knee who receive autologous chondrocyte
implantation, the evidence includes case series, systematic reviews of case series, and a network meta-analysis of prospective(none
of which evaluated autologous chondrocyte implantation) and retrospective studies. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in
disease status, morbid events, functional outcomes, and quality of life. The greatest amount of literature is for ACI of the talus.
Comparative trials are needed to determine whether ACI improves outcomes for lesions in joints other than the knee. The evidence
is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes.
Practice Guidelines and Position Statements
American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons
In its 2010 guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), the American Academy of Orthopaedic
Surgeons (AAOS) was unable to recommend for or against a specific cartilage repair technique in symptomatic skeletally immature
or mature patients with an unsalvageable osteochondritis dissecans lesion.  This recommendation of insufficient evidence was
based on a systematic review that found four level IV studies that addressed cartilage repair techniques for an unsalvageable OCD
lesion. Since each of the level IV articles utilized different techniques, different outcome measures, and differing lengths of follow-up,
the work group deemed that the evidence for any specific technique was inconclusive.
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
In 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence updated its 2005 guidance on the use of autologous chondrocyte
implantation. The NICE recommendations are stated below:
“… as an option for treating symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle and patella of the knee (International
Cartilage Repair Society grade III or IV) in adults, only if:
the person has not had previous surgery to repair articular cartilage defects;
there is minimal osteoarthritic damage to the knee (as assessed by clinicians experienced in investigating knee cartilage
damage using a validated measure for knee osteoarthritis); and
the defect is over 2 cm
."

APPROVED BY GOVERNING BODIES:
The culturing of chondrocytes is considered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to fall into the category of manipulated
autologous structural (MAS) cells, which are subject to a biologic licensing requirement. In 1997, Carticel received FDA approval for
the repair of clinically significant, “...symptomatic cartilaginous defects of the femoral condyle (medial lateral or trochlear) caused by
acute or repetitive trauma.…”
In 2016, MACI® (matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation [ACI]; Vericel), received FDA approval for the repair of
symptomatic, full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee in adult patients. MACI® consists of autologous chondrocytes which are
cultured onto a bio-resorbable porcine-derived collagen membrane. In 2017, production of Carticel was phased out and MACI® is
the only ACI product that is available in the U.S.
A number of other second-generation methods for implanting autologous chondrocytes in a biodegradable matrix are currently in
development or testing or are available outside of the United States. They include Atelocollagen (Koken), a collagen gel; Bioseed® C
(BioTissue Technologies), a polymer scaffold; CaReS (Ars Arthro), collagen gel; Cartilix (Biomet), a polymer hydrogel; Chondron
(Sewon Cellontech), a fibrin gel; Hyalograft C (Fidia Advanced Polymers), a hyaluronic acid-based scaffold; NeoCart (Histogenics), an
ACI with a 3-dimensional chondromatrix in a phase 3 trial; and Novocart®3D (Aesculap Biologics), a collagenchondroitin sulfate
scaffold in a phase 3 trial. ChondroCelect® (TiGenix), characterized as a chondrocyte implantation with a completed phase 3 trial,
uses a gene marker profile to determine in vivo cartilage-forming potential and thereby optimizes the phenotype (e.g., hyaline
2cartilage vs fibrocartilage) of the tissue produced with each ACI cell batch. Each batch of chondrocytes is graded based on the
quantitative gene expression of a selection of positive and negative markers for hyaline cartilage formation. Both Hyalograft C and
ChondroCelect® have been withdrawn from the market in Europe. In 2020, the FDA granted breakthrough status to Agili-C
(CartiHeal, Ltd.), a proprietary cell-free biocompatible and biodegradable tapered-shape implant for the treatment of cartilage
lesions in arthritic and non-arthritic joints that, when implanted into a pre-prepared osteochondral hole, acts as a 3D scaffold that
potentially supports and promotes the regeneration of the articular cartilage and its underlying subchondral bone. Agili-C was FDA-
approved in 2021 for treatment of knee-joint surface lesions with a treatable area of 1 to 7 cm
without severe osteoarthritis.

This medical policy is not an authorization, certification, explanation of benefits, or a contract. Eligibility and benefits are determined on a
case-by-case basis according to the terms of the member’s plan in effect as of the date services are rendered. All medical policies are basedCPT codes, descriptions and data copyright ©BCBSPREVIOUSYEAR American Medical Association. All rights reserved. Applicable FARS/DFARS apply.

on (i) research of current medical literature and (ii) review of common medical practices in the treatment and diagnosis of disease as of the
date hereof. Physicians and other providers are solely responsible for all aspects of medical care and treatment, including the type, quality,
and levels of care and treatment.
This policy is intended to be used for adjudication of claims (including pre-admission certification, pre-determinations, and pre-procedure
review) in Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s administration of plan contracts.
The plan does not approve or deny procedures, services, testing, or equipment for our members. Our decisions concern coverage only. The
decision of whether or not to have a certain test, treatment or procedure is one made between the physician and his/her patient. The plan
administers benefits based on the member’s contract and corporate medical policies. Physicians should always exercise their best medical
judgment in providing the care they feel is most appropriate for their patients. Needed care should not be delayed or refused because of a
coverage determination.
As a general rule, benefits are payable under health plans only in cases of medical necessity and only if services or supplies are not
investigational, provided the customer group contracts have such coverage.
The following Association Technology Evaluation Criteria must be met for a service/supply to be considered for coverage:
1
. 
The technology must have final approval from the appropriate government regulatory bodies;
2
. 
The scientific evidence must permit conclusions concerning the effect of the technology on health outcomes;
3
. 
The technology must improve the net health outcome;
4
. 
The technology must be as beneficial as any established alternatives;
5
. 
The improvement must be attainable outside the investigational setting.
Medical Necessity means that health care services (e.g., procedures, treatments, supplies, devices, equipment, facilities or drugs) that a
physician, exercising prudent clinical judgment, would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, evaluating, diagnosing or treating
an illness, injury or disease or its symptoms, and that are:
1
. 
In accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice; and
2
. 
Clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site and duration and considered effective for the patient’s illness, injury or
disease; and
3
. 
Not primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician or other health care provider; and
4
. 
Not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic
results as to the diagnosis or treatment of that patient’s illness, injury or disease.
