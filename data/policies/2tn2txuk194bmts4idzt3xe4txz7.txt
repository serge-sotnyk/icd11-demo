 Background Information  
 
- Yervoy is currently indicated for use as monotherapy in patients 12 years of age or older and as combination therapy 
with Opdivo in patients 12 years of age or older for unresectable or metastatic melanoma; as adjuvant treatment in 
patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathol ogic involvement of regional lymph nodes of more than 1 mm who 
have undergone complete resection, including total lymphadenectomy; in combination with Opdivo in advanced renal 
cell carcinoma; in combination with Opdivo in patients age 12 and older for meta static, microsatellite instability -high 
(MSI -H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer; in combination with Opdivo for patients 18 years of 
age or older with hepatocellular carcinoma in patients previously treated with sorafenib; in combinat ion with Opdivo 
for patients 18 years of age or older with previously untreated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer; in combination 
with Opdivo and platinum -doublet chemotherapy for patients 18 years of age or older with previously untreated 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer; in combination with Opdivo for the first -line treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma; and in combination with Opdivo for the first -line treatment 
of adult patietns with unresectab le advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  
 
- Unresectable or metastatic melanoma  
 
- The safety and efficacy of Yervoy as mootherapy were investigated in a randomized (3:1:1), doubleblind, double -dummy trial of 676 patients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  Patients 
were randomized to receive either Yervoy or an investigational peptide vaccine with (gp100).  The trial 
excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression an d 
those with an ECOG score greater than 1.  Yervoy or placebo was administered at 3 mg/kg as an 
intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Yervoy was found to improve overall survival versus gp100 
alone (10.0 months and 10.1 months versus 6.4 months, p<0.001 and p=0.003, respectively).  
 
- As adjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma  
 
- The EORTC 18071 trial was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial conducted with 951 high-
risk patients with stage IIIA (> 1 mm nodal involvement, IIIB, and IIIC melanoma who had undergone 
complete lymphadenectomy. Patients were randomized to receive Yervoy 10 mg/kg or placebo as an 
intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by Yervoy 10 mg/kg or placebo every 12 weeks 
from Week 24 to Week 156 (3 year s) or until documented disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.  The 
trial excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression and 
those with an ECOG score greater than 1.  In the 475 patients who received a r egimen with 10 mg/kg 
ipilimumab, median recurrence-free survival was 26.1 months, versus 17.1 months in the placebo group 
(p=0.0013).  
 
- Advanced renal cell carcinoma  
 
- The CheckMate  214 trial was a randomized, open- label study with 1096 patients with renal cell carcinoma 
that were previously untreated, 847 of those were classified as intermediate- or poor -risk patients. 
Immediate or poor risk is defined as one or more of the followin g:  less than one year from the time of 
diagnosis to the start of systemic therapy, Karnofsky performance status of < 80%, hemoglobin < 12 g/dL, 
calcium > 10.2 mg/dL, neutrophils > 7.0 x 10
9/L, or platelets > 400,000/mcL.  Patients received (1:1) either 
Yervoy plus Opdivo or sunitinib every 3 weeks for 12 weeks.  The trial excluded patients with active 
autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression and those with an ECOG score greater than 1.  While the median progression -free survival of Yervoy plus Opdivo compared to sunitinib did 
not meet the prespecified significance threshold of p = 0.009 (11.6 months and 8.4 months respectively, p = 
0.03), overall survival (not met and 26.0 months, p < 0.001) and objective response rate (42% and 27%, p < 
0.001) were significantly improved in the Yervoy plus Opdivo group as compared to the sunitinib group.

 - Metastatic, microsatellite instability -high or mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer  
 
- The CheckMate  142 trial was a phase 2 multicenter, open -label, multiple parallel- cohort study of 340 
patients with dMMR or MSI -H metastatic CRC that has progressed during or after fluoropyrimidine-, 
oxaliplatin-, or irinotecan- based chemotherapy.  In the Yervoy + Opdiv o cohort 119 patients received Opdivo 
3 mg/kg and Yervoy 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses then Opdivo 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The trial 
excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression and 
those with an ECOG  score greater than 1.  The primary endpoint was objective response as assessed by 
the investigator according to RECIST criteria.  The partial response rate was 43%, and complete response 
rate 3.7% with 46% of patients having a response to the therapy.  Of  those, 89% maintained their response 
at 6 months, and 21% at 12 months.  
 
- Hepatocellular carcinoma  
 
- The Checkmate -040 trial was a multicenter, multiple cohort, open- label trial study of 1097 patients with HCC 
who progressed on or were intolerant to sorafen ib.  Patients in cohort 4 received Yervoy 3 mg/kg every 3 
weeks for 4 doses in combination with Opdivo every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity.  The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic  
immunosuppression and those with an ECOG score greater than 1.  NCCN guidelines for hepatocellular 
carcinoma recommend use only in Child -Pugh class A patients.  The overall response rate was 33% with a 
complete and partial response in 8% and 24% of patients respectively.   
 
- Metastatic non -small cell lung cancer  
 
- The Checkmate -227 trial was a randomized, open- label, multi-part trial in patients with in patients with 
previously untreated metastatic or recurrent NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrat ions. In 
part 1a of the trial, 793 patients with PD-L1 tumor expression ≥ 1% were randomized to receive either Yervoy 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks and Opdivo 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or platinum -doublet chemotherapy every 
3 weeks for 4 cycles.  The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression and those with an ECOG score greater than 1.  The primary endpoints were 
overall survival and progression free survival.  The median overall survival was 17.1 months and 14.9 
months for the Yervoy/Opdivo arm and platinum chemotherapy arm respectively (p=0.0066).  Median 
progression -free survival was 5.1 months in the Yervoy/Opdivo arm and 5.6 months in the platinum 
chemotherapy arm (HR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.97).  
 - The Checkmate 9LA was a randomized, open -label trial in patients 18 years of age or older with previously 
untreated metastatic or recurrent NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.  Patients were 
enrolled regardless of their tumor PD- L1 status.  Patients were randomized to receive Yervoy 1 mg/kg every 
6 weeks and Opdivo 360 mg every 3 weeks and platinum -doublet therapy every 3 weeks for 2 cycles or 
platinum -doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.  The trial excluded patients with active 
autoimmune disease, those receiving systemic immunosuppression, and those with an ECOG score greater 
than 1.  The primary endpoint was overall survival.  The study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit 
in overall survival, progression free survival, and overall response rate.  
 
- Malignant pleural mesothelioma  
 
- The Checkmate -743 trial was a randomized, phase III, open -label trial of 605 patients age 18 years and 
older with unresectable pleural mesothelioma.  Patients were previously untreated and not eligible for 
curative surgery.  Patients were randomized to receive Yervoy 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks and Opdivo 3 mg/kg 
every 2 weeks for up to 2 years or cisplatin 75 mg/m
2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, or carboplatin 5 AUC and 
pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.  The trial excluded patients with active 
autoimmune disease, those receiving systemic immunosuppression, and those with an ECOG score greater This policy and any information contained herein is the property of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and its subsidiaries, is strictly confidential, and its use is 
intended for the P&T committee, its members and BCBSM employees for the purpose of coverage determinations.

 than 1.  The primary endpoint was overall survival.  The study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit 
in overall survival in the Yervoy arm compared to the placebo arm (p -value = 0.002).  
 
- Unresectable advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  
 
- The Checkmate -648 study was a randomized, active -controlled, open -label trial of 649 patients with 
previously untreated unresectable advanced, recurrent, or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  Patients were randomized to receive Yervoy 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks in combination with Opdivo 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or fluorouracil 800 mg/m
2/day days 1 through 5 and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 day 1 of a 4-week 
cycle.  Patients were excluded if they had brain metastasis, had active autoimmune disease, used systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, or patients at high risk of bleeding or fistula due to apparent invasion of tumor to organs adjacent to the esophageal tumor.  The primary endpoint was overall survival.  
The study demonstrated a significantly significant benefit in overall survival in the Yervoy are compared to 
the comparator are (p -value = 0.0110).  
 
- There are no studies to support use of Yervoy following failure of its use as a single agent or in combination with a 
PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, such as Opdivo.  NCCN guidelines also do not recommend use of Yervoy or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors following a previous failure.
