Application 
 
This Medical Benefit Drug Policy only applies to the state of New Jersey . 
 
Coverage Rationale  
 Amondys 45 (casimersen) may be covered for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients who

 For initial therapy, all of the following:  
o Diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy by, or  in consultation with, a neurologist with expertise in the diagnosis of

o Submission of medical records (e.g., chart notes, laboratory values) confirming the mutation of the DMD gene is 
amenable to exon 45 skipping; and 
o Submission of medical records  (e.g., chart notes) that provides baseline status of the patient prior to starting therapy 
(e.g., confirming that the patient is walking without needing an assistive device such as a cane, walker, wheelchair, 
etc.); and

o Amondys 45 dosing for DMD is in accordance with the United States Food and Drug Administration approved labeling;  
and 
o Amondys 45 is not used con comitantly with other exon skipping therapies for DMD; and  
o Initial authorization will be for no more than 6 months  
 For continuation of therapy, all  of the following:  
o Amondys 45 is prescribed by, or in consultation with, a neurologist with expertise in the treatment of DMD; and 
o Submission of medical records (e.g., chart notes) confirming that the patient is receiving clinical benefit ( e.g., walking 
without needing an assistive device such as a  cane, walker, wheelchair, etc.); and 
o Amondys 45 dosing for DMD is in accordance with the United States Food and Drug Administration approved labeling; and 
o Amondys 45 is not used concomitantly with other exon skipping therapies for DMD; and  
o Reauthorization will be for no more than 12 months

Applicable Codes  
 
The following list(s) of procedure and/or diagnosis codes is provided for reference purposes only and may not be all inclusiv e. 
Listing of a code in this policy does not imply that the service described by the code is a covered or non -covered health service. 
Benefit coverage for health services is determined by federal, state, or contractual requirements and applicable laws that m ay 
require coverage for a specific service. The inclusion of a code does not imply any right to reimbursement or guarantee claim  
payment. Other Policies and Guidelines may apply.  
 
HCPCS Code  Description  
J1426  Injection, casimersen, 10 mg  
 
Diagnosis Code  Description  
G71.01  Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy  
 
Background  
 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X -linked disease that affects 1 in 3,600 to  6,000 live male births. DMD occurs as a 
result of mutations (mainly deletions) in the dystrophin gene. These mutations lead to an absence or a defect of the protein,  
dystrophin, resulting in progressive muscle degeneration, leading to loss of ambulation a nd additional respiratory, orthopedic, 
and cardiac complications. If left untreated, mean age of death is approximately 19 years of age.
2-4  
 Amondys 45 (c asimersen ) is an antisense oligonucleotide of the phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) subcla ss. 
PMOs are synthetic molecules in which the five- membered ribofuranosyl rings found in natural DNA and RNA are replaced by a 
six-membered morpholino ring. Each morpholino ring is linked through an uncharged phosphorodiamidate moiety rather than 
the negatively charged phosphate linkage that is present in natural DNA and RNA. Each phosphorodiamidate morpholino 
subunit contains one of the heterocyclic bases found in DNA (adenine, cytosine, guanine, or thymine).

Casimersen is designed to bind to exon 45 of  dystrophin pre -mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA 
processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 45 skipping. Approximately 8% of DMD patients have out-of-frame deletion mutations amenable to exon 45 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to allow for production of an internally 
truncated dystrophin protein.
1 
 Eteplirsen (Exondys 51
®) was the first PMO approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for  treatment of DMD patients 
with confirmed genetic mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping. Approximately 13% of DMD patients have out -of-frame 
deletion mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping. This indication was approved under accelerated approval based on an increase in dystrophin in skeletal muscle observed in some patients treated with eteplirsen. A clinical benefit of eteplirsen has not been established.
5 Golodirsen (Vyondys 53®) and viltolarsen (Viltepso®) were the second and third exon skipping agents 
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  for treatment of DMD patients with confirmed genetic mutations amenable 
to exon 53 skipping. Approximately 8% of DMD patients have out -of-frame deletion mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping. 
Both of these agents were also approved under accelerated approval based on an increase in dystrophin in skeletal muscle observed in treated patients.  
 
Clinical Evidence  
 Casimersen is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping.

 ESSENCE is an ongoing 96 -week, Phase 3, double -blind, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial that will evaluate the 
efficacy of golodirsen and casimersen in ambulatory DMD patients with out -of-frame deletion mutations amenable to  skipping 
exon 53 and exon 45, respectively. The study will enroll 222 boys from 7 to 13 years of age with genotypically confirmed DMD and 6MWT ≥ 300 m and ≤ 450 m. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to Week 96 in 6MWT. Following the 96 -

 week double -blind period, all patients began or are to begin an additional 48 week open -label treatment period. Interim efficacy 
was assessed based on change from baseline in the dystrophin protein level (measured as % of the dystrophin level in healthy 
subject s, i.e., percent of normal determined by Western Blot) at Week 48. Interim results from 43 evaluable patients (n = 27, 
casimersen; n = 16, placebo) who had a muscle biopsy at Week 48 of the double- blind period have been reported. Patients 
randomized to cas imersen had a baseline mean dystrophin level of 0.93% of normal. At week 48, the mean dystrophin level 
increased 0.81% to 1.74% of normal. Patients randomized to placebo had a baseline mean dystrophin level of 0.54% of normal. At week 48, the mean dystroph in level increased 0.22% to 1.15% of normal. A clinically  meaningful change in level of dystrophin 
has not yet been established in humans. As such, the clinical significance of these results is not clear.

Casimersen has not been studied in DMD that is  not amenable to exon 45 skipping, or in other forms of muscular dystrophy 
(e.g., Becker muscular dystrophy).1

 Amondys 45 is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on an 
increase in dystrophin in skeletal muscle observed in patients treated with Amondys 45. Continued approval for this indication 
may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
