Background/Overview  
Venous Reflux/Venous Insufficiency  
The venous system of the lower extremities consists of the superficial veins (this includes the great 
and small saphenous and accessory, or duplicate, veins that travel in parallel with the great and small 
saphenous veins), the deep system (popliteal and femoral veins), and perforator veins that cross 
through the fascia and connect the d eep and superficial systems.  One-way valves are present within 
all veins to direct the return of blood up the lower limb. Because the  venous  pressure in the deep 
system is  generally  greater than that of the superficial system, valve incompetence at any lev el may 
lead to backflow (venous reflux) with pooling of blood in superficial veins. Varicose veins with 
visible varicosities may be the only sign of venous reflux, although itching, heaviness, tension, and 
pain may also occur. Chronic venous insufficiency secondary to venous reflux can lead to 
thrombophlebitis, leg ulcerations, and hemorrhage. The CEAP classification of venous disease 
considers the clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathologic characteristics of venous insufficiency, 
ranging from class 0 (n o visible sign of disease) to class 6 (active ulceration).  
 
Treatment of Saphenous Veins and Tributaries  
Saphenous veins include the great and small saphenous and accessory saphenous veins that travel in 
parallel with the great or small saphenous veins. Tr ibutaries are veins that empty into a larger vein. 
Treatment of venous reflux has traditionally included the following:  
• Identification by preoperative Doppler ultrasonography of the valvular incompetence  
• Control of the most proximal point of reflux, tradit ionally by suture ligation of the 
incompetent saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction  
• Removal of the superficial vein from circulation, eg, by stripping of the great and/or small 
saphenous veins.  
• Removal of varicose tributaries (at the time of the init ial treatment or subsequently) by stab 
avulsion (phlebectomy) or injection sclerotherapy.  
 
Minimally invasive alternatives to ligation and stripping have been investigated. These include forms 
of sclerotherapy, cyanocrylate adhesive, and thermal ablation u sing cryotherapy, high -frequency 
radio waves (200 to 300 kHz), or laser energy.

Thermal Ablation  
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)  is performed  using  a specially designed catheter inserted through a 
small incision in the distal medial thigh to within 1 to 2 cm of the saphenofemoral junction. The 
catheter is slowly withdrawn, closing the vein. Laser ablati on is performed  similarly. A laser fiber  is 
introduced  into the great saphenous vein under ultrasound guidance. The laser is then activated and 
slowly removed, along the course of the saphenous vein. Cryoablation uses extreme cold. The 
objective of endoven ous techniques is to injure the vessel, causing retraction and subsequent fibrotic 
occlusion of the vein. Technical developments since thermal ablation procedures were initially 
introduced include the use of perivenous tumescent anesthesia, which allows su ccessful treatment 
of veins larger than 12 mm in diameter and helps to protect adjacent tissue from thermal damage 
during treatment of the small saphenous vein.  
 
Sclerotherapy  
The objective of sclerotherapy is to destroy the endothelium of the target vesse l by injecting an 
irritant solution (either a detergent, osmotic solution, or chemical irritant), ultimately  occluding  the 
vessel. Treatment success depends on accurate injection of the vessel, an adequate injectate volume 
and concentration of sclerosant, and compression. Historically, larger veins and very tortuous veins 
were not considered good candidates for sclerotherapy due to technical limitations. Technical 
improvements in sclerotherapy have included the routine use of Duplex ultrasound to target ref luxing 
vessels, luminal compression of the vein with anesthetics, and a foam/sclerosant injectate in place 
of liquid sclerosant. Foam sclerosants are produced by forcibly mixing a gas (eg, air or carbon 
dioxide) with a liquid sclerosant (eg, polidocanol or  sodium tetradecyl sulfate). Physician -
compounded foam  is produced  at the time of treatment. A commercially available microfoam 
sclerosant with a proprietary gas mix is available and is proposed to provide a smaller and more 
consistent bubble size than wha t is produced with physician -compounded sclerosant foam.  
 
Endovenous Mechanochemical Ablation  
Endovenous mechanochemical ablation uses both sclerotherapy and mechanical damage to the 
lumen. Following ultrasound imaging, a disposable catheter with a motor d rive is inserted into the 
distal end of the target vein and advanced to the saphenofemoral junction. As the catheter  is 
pulled  back, a wire rotates at 3500 rpm within the lumen of the vein, abrading the lumen. At the 
same time, a liquid sclerosant (sodium tetradecyl sulfate)  is infused  near the rotating wire. It  is 
proposed  that mechanical ablation allows for better efficacy of the sclerosant, and results in less pain

and risk of nerve injury without the need for the tumescent anesthesia used with endovenou s thermal 
ablation techniques (RFA, endovenous laser ablation).  
 
Cyanoacrylate Adhesive  
A cyanoacrylate adhesive is a clear, free -flowing liquid that polymerizes in the vessel via an anionic 
mechanism (ie, polymerizes into a solid material on contact with body fluids or tissue). The 
adhesive  is gradually injected  along the length of the vein in conjunction with ultrasound and manual 
compression. The acute coaptation halts blood flow through the vein until the implanted adhesive 
becomes  fibrotically  encapsul ated and establishes chronic occlusion of the treated vein. 
Cyanoacrylate glue has  been used  as a surgical adhesive and sealant for a variety of indications, 
including gastrointestinal bleeding, embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations, and surgic al 
incisions or other skin wounds.  
 
Transilluminated Powered Phlebectomy  
Transilluminated powered phlebectomy is an alternative to stab avulsion and hook phlebectomy. 
This procedure uses 2 instruments: an illuminator, which also provides irrigation, and a  resector, 
which has an oscillating tip and suction pump. Following removal of the saphenous vein, the 
illuminator  is introduced  via a small incision in the skin and tumescence solution (anesthetic and 
epinephrine) is infiltrated along the course of  varicos ity. The  resector  is then inserted  under the skin 
from the opposite direction, and the oscillating tip is placed directly beneath the illuminated veins to 
fragment and loosen the veins from the supporting tissue. Irrigation from the illuminator is used to 
clear the vein fragments and blood through aspiration and additional drainage holes. The illuminator 
and resector  tips may then be repositioned, thereby reducing the number of incisions needed when 
compared with stab avulsion or hook phlebectomy. It has  been proposed  that transilluminated 
powered phlebectomy might decrease surgical time, decrease complications such as bruising, and 
lead to a  faster  recovery than established procedures.

Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer-reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines. 
 
A variety of treatment modalities are available to treat varicose veins/venous insufficiency, including 
surgery, thermal ablation, sclerotherapy, mechanochemical ablation (MOCA), cyanoacrylate 
adhesive (CAC), and cryotherapy. The application of each modality is influenced by the severity of 
the symptoms, type of vein, source of venous reflux, and the use of other (prior or concurrent) 
treatment. 
 
Summary of Evidence  
Saphenous Veins  
For individuals who have varicose veins/venous insufficiency and saphenous vein reflux who 
receive endovenous thermal ablation (radiofrequency or laser), the evidence includes randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews of controlled trials. Relevant outcomes are 
symptoms, change in disease status, morbid events, quality of life, and treatment-related morbidity. 
There are a number of large RCTs and systematic reviews of RCTs assessing endovenous thermal 
ablation of the saphenous veins. Comparison with the standard of ligation and stripping at 2- to 5-
year follow-up has supported the use of both endovenous laser ablation and radiofrequency ablation 
(RFA). Evidence has suggested that ligation and stripping lead to more neovascularization, while 
thermal ablation leads to more recanalization, resulting in similar clinical outcomes for endovenous 
thermal ablation and surgery. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in 
an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals who have varicose veins/venous insufficiency and saphenous vein reflux who 
receive microfoam sclerotherapy, the evidence includes RCTs and systematic reviews. Relevant

outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, morbid events, quality of life, an d treatment-

ligation and stripping and endovenous laser ablation for technical success up to 5 years and beyond 
5 years, but there was no significant difference between treatments for recurrence up to 3 years and 
at 5 years. For physician-compounded sclerotherapy, there is high variability in success rates and 
some reports of serious adverse events. By comparison, rates of occlusion with the microfoam 
sclerotherapy (polidocanol 1%) approved by the FDA are similar to those reported for endovenous 
laser ablation or stripping. Results of a noninferiority trial of physician-compounded sclerotherapy 
have indicated that once occluded, recurrence rates at 2 years are similar to those of ligation and 
stripping. Together, this evidence indicates that the more consistent occlusion with the microfoam 
sclerotherapy preparation will lead to recurrence rates similar to ligation and stripping in the longer 
term. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the 
net health outcome. 
 
For individuals who have varicose veins/venous insufficiency and saphenous vein reflux who 
receive MOCA, the evidence includes 4 RCTs with 6 months to 2-year results that compared MOCA 
to thermal ablation, and a prospective cohort with follow-up out to 5 years. Relevant outcomes are 
symptoms, change in disease status, morbid events, quality of life, and treatment-related morbidity. 
MOCA is a combination of liquid sclerotherapy with mechanical abrasion. A potential advantage of 
this procedure compared with thermal ablation is that MOCA does not require tumescent anesthesia 
and may result in less pain during the procedure. Results to date have been mixed regarding a 
reduction in intraprocedural pain compared to thermal ablation procedures. Occlusion rates at 6 
months to 2 years from RCTs indicate lower anatomic success rates compared to thermal ablation, 
but a difference in clinical outcomes at these early time points has not been observed. Experience 
with other endoluminal ablation procedures suggests that lower anatomic success in the short term 
is associated with recanalization and clinical recurrence between 2 to 5 years. The possibility of later 
clinical recurrence is supported by a prospective cohort study with 5-year follow-up following 
treatment with MOCA. However, there have been improvements in technique since the cohort study 
was begun, and clinical progression is frequently observed with venous disease. Because of these 
limitations, longer follow-up of the more recently conducted RCTs is needed to establish the efficacy 
and durability of this procedure compared with the criterion standard of thermal ablation. The 
evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health 
outcome.

For individuals who have varicose veins/venous insufficiency and saphenous vein reflux who 
receive CAC, the evidence includes 2 RCTs and a prospective cohort study. Relevant outcomes ar e 
symptoms, change in disease status, morbid events, quality of life, and treatment-related morbidity. 
Evidence includes a multicenter noninferiority trial with follow-up through 36 months, an RCT with 
follow-up through 24 months, and a prospective cohort with 30-month follow-up. The short-term 
efficacy of VenaSeal CAC has been shown to be noninferior to RFA at up to 36 months. At 24 and 
36 months, the study had greater than 20% loss to follow-up, but loss to follow-up was similar in the 
2 groups at the long-term follow-up and is not expected to influence the comparative results. A 
second RCT (N=525) with the same active CAC ingredient (N-butyl cyanoacrylate) that is currently 
available outside of the U.S. found no significant differences in vein closure between CAC and 
thermal ablation controls at 24-month follow-up. The CAC procedure and return to work were 
shorter and pain scores were lower compared to thermal ablation, although the subjective pain scores 
may have been influenced by differing expectations in this study. A prospective cohort study 
reported high closure rates at 30 months. Overall, results indicate that outcomes from CAC are at 
least as good as thermal ablation techniques, the current standard of care. The evidence is sufficient 
to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals who have varicose veins/venous insufficiency and saphenous vein reflux who 
receive cryoablation, the evidence includes RCTs. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in  
disease status, morbid events, quality of life, and treatment-related morbidity. Results from a recent 
RCT of cryoablation have indicated that this therapy is inferior to conventional stripping. Studies 
showing a benefit on health outcomes are needed. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the 
technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
Varicose Tributary Veins  
For individuals who have varicose tributary veins who receive ablation (stab avulsion, sclerotherapy, 
or phlebectomy) of tributary veins, the evidence includes RCTs and systematic reviews of RCTs. 
Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, morbid events, quality of life, and 
treatment -related morbidity. The literature has shown that sclerotherapy is effecti ve for treating 
tributary veins following occlusion of the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction and 
saphenous veins. No studies have been identified comparing RFA or laser ablation of tributary veins 
with standard procedures (microphlebectomy and/or  sclerotherapy). Transilluminated powered 
phlenectomy (TIPP) is effective at removing varicosities; outcomes are comparable to available

alternatives such as stab avulsion and hook phlebectomy. The evidence is sufficient to determine 
that the technology re sults in an improvement in the net health outcome.  
 
Perforator Veins  
For individuals who have perforator vein reflux who receive ablation (eg, subfascial endoscopic 
perforator surgery) of perforator veins, the evidence includes RCTs, systematic reviews of RCTs, 
and a retrospective study. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, morbid events, 
quality of life, and treatment -related morbidity. The literature has indicated that the routine ligation 
or ablation of incompetent perforator veins i s not necessary for the treatment of varicose 
veins/venous insufficiency at the time of superficial vein procedures. However, when combined 
superficial vein procedures and compression therapy have failed to improve symptoms (ie, ulcers), 
treatment of perfo rator vein reflux may be as beneficial as an alternative (eg, deep vein valve 
replacement). Comparative studies are needed to determine the most effective method of ligating or 
ablating incompetent perforator veins. Subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery  is possibly as 
effective as the Linton procedure with a reduction in adverse events. Endovenous ablation with 
specialized laser or radiofrequency probes has been shown to effectively ablate incompetent 
perforator veins with a potential decrease in morbidi ty compared with surgical interventions. The 
evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health 
outcome.  
 
Supplemental Information  
Clinical Input From  Physician Specialty Societies and Academic Medical Centers  
While the various physician specialty societies and academic medical centers may collaborate with 
and make recommendations during this process, through the provision of appropriate reviewers, 
input received does not represent an endorsement or position statement by the physician specialty 
societies or academic medical centers, unless otherwise noted. 
 
In response to requests, input was received from 4 physician specialty societies while this policy was 
under review in 2015. There was no agreement on the need to treat varicose tributaries to improve 
functional outcomes in the absence of saphenous vein  disease. Input was also mixed on the use of 
mechanochemical ablation and cyanoacrylate adhesiv e.

America n Venous Forum et al  
In 2020, in response to published reports of potentially inappropriate application of venous 
procedures, the American Venous Forum, Society for Vascular Surgery, American Vein and 
Lymphatic Society, and the Society of Interventional Radiology published appropriate use criteria 
for the treatment of chronic lower extremity venous disease.58, Appropriate use criteria were 
developed using the RAND/UCLA method incorporating best available evidence and expert 
opinion. 
 
Appropriate use criteria were determined for various scenarios (eg, symptomatic, asymptomatic, 
CEAP [Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy and Pathophysiology] class, axial reflux, saphenofemoral 
junction reflux) for the following: 
• Saphenous vein ablation  
o Great saphenous vein  
o Small saphen ous vein  
o Accessory great saphenous vein  
• Nontruncal varicose veins  
• Diseased tributaries associated with saphenous ablation  
• Perforator veins  
• Iliac vein or inferior vena cava stenting as a first line treatment  
• Duplex ultrasound  
• Timing and reimbursement.  
 
Treatment of saphenous veins for asymptomatic CEAP class 1 and 2, or symptomatic class 1, was 
considered to be rarely appropriate or never appropriate, and treatment of symptomatic CEAP class 
2, 3, and 4 to 6 without reflux was rated as never appropriate. Based on the 2011 Guidelines from 
the Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum (see below), treatment of perforator 
veins for asymptomatic or symptomatic CEAP class 1 and 2 was considered to be rarely appropriate

or never appropriate. Perfora tor vein treatment was rated as appropriate for CEAP classes 4 to 6, and 
may be appropriate for CEAP class 3. Except for a recommendation to use endovenous procedures 
for perforator vein ablation, techniques used to treat veins in these scenarios were not evaluated.  
 
Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum  
The Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum (2011) published joint clinical 
practice guidelines. Table 1 provides the recommendations.

Diseases  
Recommendation  Gradea SOR  QOE  
Compression therapy for venous ulcerations and varicose veins     
Compression therapy is recommended as the primary treatment to aid 
healing of venous ulceration  1B Strong  Moderate  
To decrease the recurrence of venous ulcers, ablation of the incompetent 
superficial veins in addition to compression therapy  is recommended  1A Strong  High

American Vein and Lymphatic Society  
In 2015, the American Vein and Lymphatic Society (AVL, previously named the American College 
of Phlebology) published guidelines on the treatment of superficial vein disease. 
 
AVL gave a Grade 1 recommendation based on high quality evidence that compression is an 
effective method for the management of symptoms, but when patients have a correctable source of 
reflux, definitive treatment should be offered unless contraindicated. AVL recommends against a 
requirement for compression therapy when a definitive treatment is available. AVL gave a strong 
recommendation based on moderate quality evidence that endovenous thermal ablation is the 
preferred treatment for saphenous and accessory saphenous vein incompetence, and gave a weak 
recommendation based on moderate quality evidence that mechanochemical ablation may also be 
used to treat venous reflux. 
 
In 2017, AVL published guidelines on the treatment of refluxing accessory saphenous veins. The 
College gave a Grade 1 recommendation based on level C evidence that patients with symptomatic 
incompetence of the accessory saphenous veins be treated with endovenous thermal ablation or 
sclerotherapy to reduce symptomatology. The guidelines noted that although accessory saphenous 
veins may drain into the great saphenous vein before it drains into the common femoral vein, they 
can also empty directly into the common femoral vein. 
 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  
In 2013, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its guidance on 
ultrasound -guided foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins. NICE stated that:

"1.1 Current evidence on the efficacy of ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins is 
adequate. The evidence on safety is adequate, and provided that patients are warned of the small but 
significant risks of foam embolization (see section 1.2), this procedure may be used with normal 
arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit. 
 
1.2 During the consent process, clinicians should inform patients that there are reports of temporary 
chest tightness, dry cough, headaches and visual disturbance, and rare but significant complications 
including myocardial infarction, seizures, transient ischemic attacks and stroke." 
 
In 2015, NICE published a technology assessment on the clinical effectiveness and  cost-
effectiveness of foam sclerotherapy, endovenous laser ablation, and surgery for varicose veins. 
 
In 2016, NICE revised its guidance on endovenous mechanochemical ablation, concluding that 
"Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of endovenous mechanochemical ablation for varicose 
veins appears adequate to support the use of this procedure...."

*Investigational – A medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product is 
Investigational if the effectiveness has not been clearly tested and it has not been incorpo rated into 
standard medical practice. Any determination we make that a medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is Investigational will be based on a consideration of the following: 
A. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product can be 
lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
whether such approval has been granted at the time the medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is sought to be furnished; or 
B. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product requires 
further studies or clinical trials to determine its maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, safety, 
effectiveness, or effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or 
diagnosis, must improve health outcomes, according to the consensus of opinion among 
experts as shown by reliable evidence, including: 
1. Consultation with technology evaluation center(s); 
2. Credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community; or 
3. Reference to federal regulations. 
 
**Medically Necessary (or “Medical Necessity”) - Health care services, treatment, procedures,
