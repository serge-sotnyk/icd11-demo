Based on review of available data, the Company may consider a quantity override for ruxolitinib 
(Opzelura) to be eligible for coverage.**  
 
Patient Selection Criteria 
A quantity override for ruxolitinib (Opzelura), up to 240 grams per 28 days, will be considered when 
the following criterion is met: 
• Patient requires more than 120 grams of the requested drug every 28 days  
 
When Services Are Considered Not Medically Necessary  
Based on review of available data, the Company considers the use of ruxolitinib (Opzel ura) in 
quantities greater than 120 grams per 28 days when there is no documentation that the patient 
requires more than 120 grams per 28 days be not medically necessary**  
 
Background/Overview  
Opzelura  is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor indicated for the topical short -term and non -continuous 
chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in non -immunocompromised patients 12 
years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with t opical prescription therapies 
or when those therapies are not advisable.  It is also indicated for the topical treatment of 
nonsegmental vitiligo in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. The package insert 
notes that Opzelura use in combi nation with therapeutic biologics, such as Dupixent , other JAK 
inhibitors (such as Xeljanz or Rinvoq), or potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or 
cyclosporine is not recommended. Opzelura is applied as a thin layer twice daily to affected areas  
for both indications . No more than 60 grams per week should be used.  
 
Atopic Dermatitis 
Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition associated with dry skin, pruritus, and 
inflammation. There are various treatment options for atopic dermatitis, including first line agents 
such as topical corticosteroids (many of which are in generic form) and topical immunomodulatory 
agents such as generic tacrolimus and generic pimecrolimus. For those that are refractory to topical 
therapies, systemic immunomodulatory agents are an option for therapy. Opzelura offers another 
topical option for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. It’s place in therapy is currently undefined.

Nonsegmental Vitiligo 
Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease that targets melanocytes, causing skin depigmentation that 
leaves the skin looking white or pink in appearance. It can affect any part of the body yet is 
asymptomatic in most patients. There are two different types of vitiligo: segmental and 
nonsegmental, which is the most common type of vitiligo. Segmental vitiligo may begin during 
childhood or early adulthood. It typically occurs in a dermatomal or quasi-dermatomal pattern, most 
frequently along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. The affected areas typically stabilize within 
a year and rarely spread beyond that dermatome. Segmental vitiligo can be classified as 
monosegmental, bisegmental, or plurisegmental. Nonsegmental vitiligo consists of several different 
subtypes. These include generalized, acrofacial or acral, mucosal, universal, and vitiligo minor. 
Generalized vitiligo is characterized by a random distribution of depigmented macules or patches 
that are often bilateral and symmetrical and occur commonly on the face, trunk, and extremities. 
Acrofacial or acral vitiligo is vitiligo that is mainly confined to the face and distal extremities. 
Mucosal vitiligo involves the oral and genital mucosa. Universal vitiligo is typically a form of 
progression of generalized vitiligo and is characterized by complete or nearly complete 
depigmentation of the skin. Vitiligo minor, which is more commonly seen in individuals of a darker 
complexion, is characterized by an incomplete loss of pigmentation, and is also called hypochromic 
vitiligo. Treatment for this condition mainly consists of off -label use of topical or oral 
corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and phototherapy. Opzelura is the first approved drug 
for the treatment of vitiligo.  
 
FDA or Other Governmental Regulatory Approval  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Opzelura is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor indicated for the topical short-term and non-continuous 
chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised patients 12 
years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies 
or when those therapies are not advisable. Opzelura is also indicated for the topical treatment of 
nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.

Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer-reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines. 
 
Atopic Dermatitis 
Two double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled trials of identical design (Trial 1 and Trial 2, 
respectively) enrolled a total of 1,249 subjects aged 12 and older. A total of 20% of subjects were 
12 to 17 years of age and 9% were 65 years or older. Subjects had affected body surface area (BSA) 
of 3 to 20%, and an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 2 (mild) to 3 (moderate) on a 
severity scale of 0 to 4. The baseline Itch Numerical Rating Scale (Itch NRS), defined as the 7 -day 
average of the worst level of itch intensity in the last 24 hours, was 5 on a scale of 0 to 10.  
In both trials, subjects were randomized 2:2:1 to treatment with Opzelura, ruxolitinib cream 0.75%, 
or vehicle cream twice daily (BID) for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion 
of subjects at week 8 achieving IGA treatment success (IGA-TS) defined as a score of 0 (clear) or 1 
(almost clear ) with ≥ 2 grade improvement from baseline. In Trial 1, 53.8% of Opzelura patients 
achieved the primary endpoint vs. 15.1% in the vehicle group. In Trial 2, 51.3% of Opzelura patients 
achieved the primary endpoint vs. 7.6% in the vehicle group.  
 
Nonsegmental Vitiligo 
Two double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled trials of identical design (Trial 1 and Trial 2, 
respectively) enrolled a total of 674 adult and pediatric subjects aged 12 years and older. Subjects 
had depigmented areas affecting ≥ 0.5% facia l body surface area (F- BSA), ≥ 3% non -facial BSA, 
and total body vitiligo area (facial and non-facial, including hands, feet, upper and lower extremities, 
and trunk body areas) of up to 10% BSA. At baseline, subjects had a mean affected F-BSA of 1% 
and a mean affected total BSA of 7.4%. Phototherapy was not permitted during the trial. In both 
trials, subjects were randomized 2:1 to treatment with Opzelura or vehicle cream twice daily (BID) 
for 24 weeks followed by an additional 28 weeks of treatment with Opzelura BID for all subjects. 
Lesions on the face were assessed with the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI) and lesions 
on the total body (including the face) were assessed with the total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index 
(T-VASI). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving at least 75%
