Introduction  
A newborn baby’s skull is made up of several bones that are not yet solidly connected to each 
other. This allows the infant’s skull to grow and get bigger as the baby’s brain grows. 
Sometimes, the baby’s skull may have become flattened or misshaped during the birthing 
process or for other reasons. This abnormal skull shape is called plagiocephaly. Adjustable 
helmets (a cranial orthotic) may be used to reshape flattened areas of a baby’s skull. However, 
there is no medical evidence that a child’s development is affected by a head that is not exactly 
the same shape on both sides. Using a helmet in this situation is cosmetic.  
The skull bones may also fuse together too soon. This is dangerous, as it will not allow the brain 
to grow inside this solid skull. This can cause brain damage, developmental delay, and problems 
with thinking. Fusion of the skull bones is called synostosis. Surgery is needed to open up the 
space between the skull bones to allow the brain to grow normally. Helmets may be used after skull surgery to help protect the brain and reshape the bones.  
This policy describes when an adjustable helmet may be medically necessary.  
 
Note:    The Introduction section is for your general knowledge and is not to be taken  as policy coverage criteria. The 
rest o f the policy uses specific words and concepts familiar to medical professionals. It is intended for 
providers . A provider can be a person, such as a doctor, nurse, psychologist, or dentist. A provider also can 
be a place where medical care is given, like a  hospital, clinic, or lab.  This policy informs them about when a 
service may be covered.

Policy Coverage Criteria   
 
Treatment  Medical Necess ity 
Adjustable cranial orthosis  Use of an adjustable cranial orthosis (cranial banding or soft 
shell helmet) may be considered medically necessary when the 
following criteria are met:  
• Age is between 3 and 18 months of age 
AND  
• The device is custom made and  fitted for the individual  
AND  
• Either of the following is present:  
o The child has had surgery for crainiosynostosis, and the 
orthosis is needed for post -operative care 
      OR  
o The child has severe positional plagiocephaly* that has not 
responded to a two-month trial of repositioning and/or 
physical therapy 
 *Severe plagiocephaly is defined by the following:  
• 10 mm or more of asymmetry in one of the following measures: cranial vault, skull base, or orbitotragial depth (see 
Table  1 below)  
OR 
• Cephalic index at least two standard deviations above or below 
the mean for the appropriate gender and age (see Table 2  
below)  
 
Use of an adjustable cranial orthosis is considered not 
medically necessary for all other indications not outlined 
above.

 Treatment  Medical Necess ity 
Note:  A protective helmet (HCPCS code A800 0-A8004) is not a cranial 
orthosis/cranial remolding device. It is considered a safety device worn to 
prevent injury to the head. It is not addressed in this policy.  
 
Evaluation of Plagiocephaly 
The diagnosis of the type of craniosynostosis is confirmed through physical examination and 
imaging studies. 
Anthropometric data, or the measurements used to evaluate abnormal head shape by 
measuring the distance in mm from one pre -designated point on the face or skull to another 
must document moderate to severe plagiocephaly. 
The evaluation of cranial asymmetry may be based on one or more of four anthropometri c 
measures: cranial vault, skull base, orbitotragial depth measurements or the cephalic index. 
 
Table 1. Anth ropometric Measurements 
Anthropometric Measure  Measurement  
Cranial Vault  [left frontozygomatic point (fz) to right euryon (eu)] minus [right frontozygomatic 
point (fz) to left euryon (eu)]  
Skull Base  [subnasal point (sn) to left tragus (t)] minus [subnasal point (sn) to right tragus (t)]  
Orbitotragial Depth  [left exocanthion point (ex) to left tragus (t)] minus [right exocanthion point (ex) to 
right tragus (t)  
 
Evaluation of cranial asymmetry may be based on the cephalic index, a ratio between the width 
and length of the head. Typically, head width is calculated by subtracting the distance from 
euryon (eu) on one side of the head to euryon on the other side of head and multiplying by 100. 
Head length is generally calculated by measuring the distance from glabella point (g) to 
opisthocranion point (op). The cephalic index is then calculated as:  
• Head width (eu – eu) x 100  
• Head length (g – op)  Page | 4 of 16  ∞  
 The cephalic index is considered abnormal if it is two standard deviations above or below the 
mean measurements (Farkas and Munro, 1987).

Documentation Requirements  
The individual ’s medical records submitted for review should document that medical 
necessity criteria are met. The records should include the following:  
• Child age is between 3 and 18 months old  
AND   
• One of the following must be present: 
o Child had surgery for craniosynostosis (the bones in the child’s skull join together too 
early), and the cranial orthosis is needed for post -operative care 
OR 
o The child has persistent plagiocephaly (the child’s head is flat in the back or on one side) or 
brachycephaly (shortened front to back dimension of the skull)  without synostosis (fusion 
of the two bones) : 
 Cephalic index at least two standard deviations above or below the mean (for the 
appropriate gender and age)  Page | 5 of 16  ∞

Procedures are considered medically necessary if there is a significant physical functional 
impairment, and the procedure can be reasonably expected to improve the physical functional 
impairment ( i.e., improve health outcomes). In this policy, procedures are considered 
reconstructive when intended to address a significant variation from normal related to accidental injury, disease, trauma, treatment of a disease, or congenital defect. T here are no 
conc lusive data that nonsynostotic plagiocephaly is associated with a functional impairment; 
therefore, its treatment would be considered cosmetic. 
Assessment of plagiocephaly in research studies may be based on anthropomorphic measures 
of the head, using anatomic and bony landmarks. Although there is no accepted minimum 
objective level of asymmetry for a plagiocephaly diagnosis, there are definitions that have been adopted by convention. Table 3  presents normative values and the mean pretreatment 
asymmetries reported in large case series. These may be useful in determining if a significant variation from normal is present.

a In this report, the asymmetry was measured from the tragus to the frontozygomatic point instead of the 
exocanthion. 
 
Consideration of Age  
The ages referenced in this policy for which cranial orthoses are considered medically necessary 
are between 3 and 1 8 months. This is based on the FDA -approved age range for these helmets 
and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states, "The use of helmets and other related devices seems to be beneficial primarily when there has been a lack of response to mechanical 
adjustments and exercises, and the best response to helmets occurs in the age range of 4 to 12 months of age."  
 
Definition of Terms  
Anthrop omorphic Assessment of Plagiocephaly  
Brach ycephaly: Shortened front to back dimension of the skull that results from premature 
fusion of the coronal suture  
Coronal suture: Skull joint that goes across the top of the skull and separates the front and back halves of the skull  
Cranial base:  Asymmetry of the cranial base is measured from the subnasal  point (midline 
under the nose) to the tragus (the cartilaginous projection in front of the external auditory canal ) 
Cephalic index:  The cephalic index, which describes a ratio of the maximum width to the head 
length expressed as a percentage, is used to assess abnormal head shapes without asymmetry. Page | 7 of 16  ∞  
 The maximum width is measured between the most lateral points of the head located in the 
parietal region ( i.e., euryon). The head length is measured from the most prominent point in the 
median sagittal plane between the supraorbital ridges ( i.e., glabella) to the most prominent 
posterior point of the occiput ( i.e., the opisthocranion), expressed as a percentage. The cephalic 
index can then be compared to normative measures for age and gender. 
Cranial  vault  asymm etry: Is assessed by measuring from the frontozygomaticus point 
(identified by palpation of the suture line above the upper outer corner of the orbit) to the 
euryon, defined as the most lateral point on the head located in the parietal region.  
Craniosynostosis:  Fusion of at least two of the skull bones before the brain has fully formed . 
Metopic suture:  Skull joint that separates the left and right halves of the forehead . 
Orbitotragial depth:  Asymmetry of the orbitotragial depth is measured from the exocanthion 
(outer corner of the eye fissure where the eyelids meet) to the tragus (the cartilaginous projection in front of the external auditory canal ) 
Plagiocephaly : Flattening of the skull on the back or one side of the head . 
Sagittal suture: Skull joint that separates the left and right halves of the skull . 
Synosto sis: Fusion of two bones 
 
Evidence Review   
 
Description 
Cranial orthoses involve an adjustable helmet or band that progressively molds the shape of the 
infant cranium by applying corrective forces to prominences while leaving room for growth in 
the adjacent flattened areas. A cranial orthotic device may be used  to treat postsurgical 
synostosis or positional plagiocephaly in pediatric individuals.  
 Page | 8 of 16  ∞  
 Background  
Craniosynostoses  
An asymmetrically shaped head may be synostotic or nonsynostotic. Synostosis, defined as 
premature closure of the sutures of the cranium, may result in functional deficits secondary to 
increased  intracranial pressure in an abnormally or asymmetrically shaped cranium. The type 
and degree of craniofacial deformity depend on the type of synostosis. The most common is scaphocephaly, a narrowed and elongated head resulting from synostosis of the sagittal suture. Trigonocephaly, in contrast, is premature fusion of the metopic suture and  results in a triangular 
shape of the forehead. Unilateral synostosis of the coronal suture results in an asymmetric 
distortion of the forehead called plagiocephaly, and fusion of both coronal sutures results in 
brachycephaly. Combinations of these deformities may also occur.  
 
Treatment  
Synostotic deformities associated with functional deficits are addressed  by surgical remodeling 
of the cranial vault. The remodeling (reshaping) is accomplished by opening and expanding the 
abnormally fused bone.  
In a review of the treatment of craniosynostosis, Persing (2008) indicated that premature fusion 
of one or more cranial vault sutures occurs in approximately 1 in 2500 births.
1 Of these 
craniosynostoses, asymmetric deformities involving the cranial vault and base ( e.g., unilateral 
coronal synostosis) will have a higher rate of postoperative deformity, which would requi re 
additional surgical treatment. Persing (2008) suggested that use of cranial orthoses postoperatively may serve two functions: (1) they protect the brain in areas of large bony 
defects, and (2) they may remodel the asymmetries in skull shape, particularly when the bone segments are more mobile. 
 
Plagiocephaly  
Plagiocephaly without synostosis, also called positional or deformational plagiocephaly, can be 
secondary to various environmental factors including, but not limited to, premature birth, 
restrictive intrauterine environment, birth trauma, torticollis, cervical anomalies, and sleeping 
position. Positional plagiocephaly typically consists of right or left occipital flattening with advancement of the ipsilateral ear and ipsilateral frontal bone protrusion, resulting in visible Page | 9 of 16  ∞  
 facial asymmetry. Occipital flattening may be self -perpetuating in that once it occurs, it may be 
increasingly difficult for the infant to turn and sleep on the other side. Bottle feeding, a low 
proportion of “tummy time” while awake, multiple gestations, and slow achievement of motor 
milestones may contribute to positional plagiocephaly. The incidence of plagiocephaly has 
increased rapidly in recent years; this is believed to be a result of the “Back to Sleep” campaign 
recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, in which a supine sleeping position is 
recommended to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. It has been suggested that 
increasing awareness of identified risk factors and early implementation of good practices will reduce the development of deformational plagiocephaly. 
 
Summary of Evidence  
For individuals who have open or endoscopic surgery for craniosynostosis who receive a 
postoperative cranial orthosis, the evidence includes case series. The relevant outcomes are 
change in disease status, morbid events, functional outcomes, quality of life, and treatment -
related morbidity. Overall, the evidence on the efficacy of cranial orthoses following endoscopic-
assisted or open cranial vault remodeling surgery for craniosynostosis is limited. However, 
functional impairments are related to craniosynostosis, and there is a risk of harm from 
additional surgery when severe deformity has not been corrected. Because cranial orthoses can 
facilitate remodeling, use of a cranial orthosis is likely to improve outcomes after cranial vault 
remodeling for synostosis. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in 
an improvement in the net health outcome.  
For individuals who have positional plagiocephaly who receive a cranial orthosis, the evidence includes a comparative study and case series. The relevant outcomes are a change in disease 
status, morbid events, functional outcomes, quality of life, and trea tment -related morbidity. 
Overall, evidence on an association between positional plagiocephaly and health outcomes is 
limited. The largest controlled study found no difference in function between infants with 
plagiocephaly and age- matched concurrent control s. Taking into consideration the limited 
number of publications over the past decade and the low likelihood of development of high-
level evidence from controlled studies, the scientific literature is limited in  support of an effect of 
deformational plagioc ephaly on functional health outcomes. The evidence is insufficient to 
determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.

 Additional Information  
2008 Input  
Multiple medical organization guidelines have supported use of orthoses for positional 
plagiocephaly with criteria. The conditions for which the medical organizations noted that use of 
helmets and related devices seem to be primarily beneficial may, therefore, be considered medically necessary.

Clinical Input Received f rom Physician Specialty Societies and Academic 
Medical Centers  
The purpose of the following information is to provide reference material. Inclusion does not 
imply endorsement or alignment with the policy conclusions. 
While the various physician specialty societies and academic medical centers may collaborate 
with and make recommendations during this process, through the provision of appropriate 
reviewers, input received does not represent an endorsement or position statement by the 
physician specialty societies or academic medical centers, unless otherwise noted.  Page | 11 of 16  ∞  
 In response to requests, input was received from three  physician specialty societies ( four 
reviews) and two academic medical centers while this policy was under review in 2008. Input was 
mixed about whether the use of helmets or adjustable banding for treatment of plagiocephaly 
or brachycephaly without synostosis should be considered medically necessary or not medically 
necessary. Clinical input agreed that cranial orthoses may be indicated following cranial vault 
surgery.  
 
Practice Guidelines and Position Statements  
Guidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion if they were issued by, or jointly by, a U .S. professional society, an international society with U.S. representation, or 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines that are informed by a systematic review, include strength of evidence ratings, and include a 
description of management of conflict of interest.  
 
Congress of Neurological Surgeons and Section on Pediatric Neurosurgery   
In 2016, the Congress of Neurological Surgeons and the Section on Pediatric Neurosurgery 
commissioned a systematic review to inform a joint evidence- based guideline on the role of 
cranial molding orthosis therapy for individuals with positional plagiocephaly.24,25 The guideline 
was issued by a multidisciplinary task force that included clinical and methodological experts; all 
task force members were required to disclose potential conflicts of interest. The guideline was 
endorsed by  the Joint Guidelines Committee of the American Association of Neurological 
Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons and American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP). 
The guideline  provided level II recommendations (uncertain clinical certainty) on the use of 
helmet therapy “for infants with persistent moderate to severe plagiocephaly after a course of conservative treatment (repositioning and/or physical therapy)” and “for infants with moderate 
to severe plagiocephaly presenting at an advanced age.” The recommendations were based on a 
randomized controlled trial, five  prospective comparative studies, and nine retrospective 
comparative studies (all rated as class II evidence).

 Natio nal Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  
In 2019, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has stated that “T reatment 
for craniosynostosis generally consists of surgery to improve the symmetry and appearance of 
the head and to relieve pressure on the brain and the cranial nerves [although] for some 
children with less severe problems, cranial molds can reshape the skull to accommodate brain growth and improve the appearance of the head.”

Medicare National Coverage  
There is no national coverage determination.  
 
Regulatory Status  
Multiple cranial orthoses (helmets) have been cleared for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) through the 510(k) process and are intended to apply passive pressure to 
prominent regions of an infant’s cranium to improve cranial symmetry and/or shape in infants from three to 18 months of age. Multiple marketed  devices are labeled for use in children with 
moderate to severe nonsynostotic positional plagiocephaly, including infants with plagiocephalic - and brachycepha lic-shaped heads.  
FDA product code: MVA.
