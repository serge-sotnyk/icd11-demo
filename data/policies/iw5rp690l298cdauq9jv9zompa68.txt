Policy Guidelines  
Mitochondrial disorders can be caused by variants in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA 
(nDNA). A 3 -generation family history may suggest a mode of inheritance. A family history in 
which af fected women transmit the disease to male and female children and affected men do not 
transmit the disease to their children suggests the familial variant(s) is in the mtDNA. A family 
history consistent with Mendelian autosomal dominant or autosomal recess ive inheritance or with 
X-linked inheritance suggests the familial variant(s) is in the nDNA.  De novo  pathogenic variants 
are also possible.

Testing Strategy 
 
Individuals With a Suspected Mitochondrial Disorder 
If the phenotype is highly suggestive of a specific disorder that is supported by the inheritance pattern 
noted in the family history, it would be reasonable to begin genetic testing with single genes or 
targeted multigene panels that test for pathogenic variants specific for that disorder. 
 
If a mitochondrial disorder is suspected, but the phenotype is nonspecific, broader genetic testing is 
appropriate under the guidance of a clinical geneticist and genetics counselor. For patients in whom 
the family history is suggestive of a disorder due to pathogenic variant(s) in mtDNA, multigene 
panels or sequencing of the mitochondrial genome may be appropriate. If multiple mtDNA deletions 
are noted, or the family history is suggestive of a disorder due to variants in nDNA, then multigene 
panels covering known nuclear genes associated with mitochondrial disease may be appropriate. 
Testing using whole exome sequencing is reviewed in medical policy 00389 (Whole Exome and 
Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders). 
 
Individuals With a Family Member With a Mitochondrial Disorder and Known Familial 
Variant 
Targeted testing of the parents of a proband with a mitochondrial disorder and a confirmed 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic gene variant is done to identify mode of transmission [germline 
(autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked, mitochondrial) vs. de novo ] thereby indicating 
risk for future offspring and other family members. Targeted testing for a known familial variant in 
parents and other at-risk relatives as part of preconceptional carrier testing is appropriate. At-risk 
relatives include only female relatives if the familial pathogenic variant is in the mtDNA but includes 
both male and female relatives if the familial pathogenic variant is in the nDNA. 
 
Genetics Nomenclature Update 
The Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found 
in DNA and serves as an international standard in DNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for 
genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's 
nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human Genome Organization, 
and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself.

Genetic Counseling 
Experts recommend formal genetic counseling for patients who are at risk for inherited disorders 
and who wish to undergo genetic testing. Interpreting the results of genetic tests and understanding 
risk factors can be difficult for some patients; genetic counseling helps individuals understand the 
impact of genetic testing, including the possible effects the test results could have on the individual 
or their family members. It should be noted that genetic counseling may alter the utilization of 
genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing; further, genetic counseling should 
be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic medicine and genetic testing 
methods. 
 
Background/Overview  
Mitochondrial DNA 
Mitochondria are organelles within each cell that contain their own set of DNA, distinct from the 
nuclear DNA (nDNA) that makes up most of the human genome. Human mitochondrial DNA 
(mtDNA) consists of 37 genes. Thirteen genes code for protein subunits of the mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation complex and the remaining 24 genes are responsible for proteins involved 
in the translation and/or assembly of the mitochondrial complex. Additionally, there are over 1000 
nuclear genes coding for proteins that support mitochondrial function. The protein products from 
these genes are produced in the nucleus and later migrate to the mitochondria. 
 
Mitochondrial DNA differs from nDNA in several important ways. Inheritance of mtDNA does not 
follow traditional Mendelian patterns. Rather, mtDNA is inherited only from maternal DNA so 
disorders that result from variants in mtDNA can only be passed on by the mother. Also, there are 
thousands of copies of each mtDNA gene in each cell, as opposed to nDNA, which contains only 1 
copy per cell. Because there are many copies of each gene, variants may be present in some copies 
of the gene but not others. This phenomenon is called heteroplasmy. Heteroplasmy can be expressed 
as a percentage of genes that have the variant ranging from 0% to 100%. Clinical expression of the 
variant will generally depend on a threshold effect (ie, clinical symptoms will begin to appear when 
the percentage of mutated genes exceeds a threshold amount). 
 
Mitochondrial Diseases 
Primary mitochondrial diseases arise from dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The 
mitochondrial respiratory chain is responsible for aerobic metabolism, and dysfunction, therefore,

affects a wide variety of physiologic pathways dependent on aerobic metabolism. Organs with a 
high-energy requirement, such as the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and skeletal 
muscle, are preferentially affected by mitochondrial dysfunction. 
 
The prevalence of these disorders has risen over the last 2 decades as the pathophysiology and 
clinical manifestations have been better characte rized. It is currently estimated that the minimum 
prevalence of primary mitochondrial diseases is at least 1 in 5000.  
 
Some specific mitochondrial diseases are listed next:  
• Mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke -like symptoms (MELAS) 
syndrome;  
• Myoclon us epilepsy with ragged red fibers syndrome (MERFF);  
• Kearns -Sayre syndrome;  
• Leigh syndrome;  
• Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO);  
• Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON);  
• Neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) . 
 
Most of these disorders are characterized by multisystem dysfunction, which generally includes 
myopathies and neurologic dysfunction and may involve multiple other organs. Each defined 
mitochondrial disease has a characteristic set of signs or symptoms. The severity of illness is 
heterogeneous and can vary markedly. Some patients will have only mild symptoms for which they 
never require medical care, while other patients have severe symptoms, a large burden of morbidity, 
and a shortened life exp ectancy.  
 
Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases can be difficult. The individual symptoms are nonspecific, 
and symptom patterns can overlap considerably. As a result, a patient often cannot be easily 
classified into a particular syndrome. Biochemical testing is indicated for patients who do not have 
a clear clinical picture of a specific disorder. Measurement of serum lactic acid is often used as a 
screening test but the test is neither sensitive nor specific for mitochondrial diseases.

A muscle biopsy can be performed if the diagnosis is uncertain after biochemical workup. However, 
this invasive test is not definitive in all cases. The presence of "ragged red fibers" on histologic 
analysis is consistent with a mitochondrial disea se. Ragged red fibers represent a proliferation of 
defective mitochondria.  This characteristic finding may not be present in all types of mitochondrial 
diseases and also may be absent early in the course of disease.  
 
Treatment 
Treatment of mitochondrial disease is largely supportive because there are no specific therapies that 
impact the natural history of the disorder. Identification of complications such as diabetes and 
cardiac dysfunction is important for early treatment of these conditions. A number of vitamins and 
cofactors (eg, coenzyme Q, riboflavin) have been used but empirical evidence of benefit is lacking. 
Exercise therapy for myopathy is often prescribed but the effect on clinical outcomes is uncertain. 
The possibility of gene transfer therapy is under consideration but is at an early stage of development 
and untested in clinical trials. 
 
Genetic Testing 
Mitochondrial diseases can be caused by pathogenic variants in the maternally inherited mtDNA or 
one of many nDNA genes. Genetic testing for mitochondrial diseases may involve testing for point 
mutations, deletion and duplication analysis, and/or whole exome sequencing of nuclear or mtDNA. 
The type of testing done depends on the specific disorder being considered. For some primary 
mitochondrial diseases such as MELAS and MERFF, most variants are point mutations, and there 
is a finite number of variants associated with the disorder. When testing for one of these disorders, 
known pathogenic variants can be tested for with polymerase chain reaction, or sequence analysis 
can be performed on the particular gene. For other mitochondrial diseases, such as CPEO and 
Kearns-Sayre syndrome, the most common variants are deletions, and therefore duplication and 
deletion analysis would be the first test when these disorders are suspected. Table 1 provides 
examples of clinical symptoms and particular genetic variants in mtDNA or nDNA associated with 
particular mitochondrial syndromes. A repository of published and unpublished data on variants in 
human mtDNA is available in the MITOMAP database. Lists of mtDNA and nDNA genes that may 
lead to mitochondrial diseases and testing laboratories in the U.S. are provided at Genetic Testing 
Registry of the National Center for Biotechnology Information website.

Ration ale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer -reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical pract ice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines.  
 
Mitochondrial diseases are multisystem diseases that arise from dysfunction in the mitochondrial 
protein complexes involved in oxidative metabolism. There are many related but distinct syndromes 
and some patients have overlapping syndromes. As a result, these disorders can be difficult to 
diagnose. Genetic testing  has the potential to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for mitochondrial 
diseases. Genetic testing also has the potential to determine future risk of disease in individuals who 
have a close relative with a pathogenic variant.  
 
Diagnostic genetic testing f or mitochondrial disorders and carrier testing of known familial variants 
associated with mitochondrial disorders is addressed in this review.  
 
Summary of Evidence 
For individuals with signs and/or symptoms of a mitochondrial disease who receive genetic testing, 
the evidence includes case series and cohort studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, other test 
performance measures, symptoms, functional outcomes, health status measures, and quality of life. 
There is some evidence on clinical validity that varies by the patient population and testing strategy. 
Studies reporting diagnostic yield for known pathogenic variants using next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) panels tend to report rates ranging from 15% to 25%. Clinical specificity is unknown, but 
population-based studies have indicated that the prevalence of certain variants exceeds the 
prevalence of clinical disease, suggesting that the variant will be found in some people without the 
clinical disease (false-positives). Clinical utility is relatively high for confirming the diagnosis of

mitochondrial diseases in people who have signs and symptoms of the disease. In these patients, a 
positive result in genetic testi ng can avoid a muscle biopsy and eliminate the need for further clinical 
workup. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the 
net health outcome.  
 
For individuals who are asymptomatic with a close relative wi th a mitochondrial disease and a 
known pathogenic variant and who receive targeted familial variant testing, the evidence includes 
case series and cohort studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, other test performance measures, 
changes in reproductive  decision making, symptoms, functional outcomes, health status measures, 
and quality of life. Clinical validity is expected to be high for targeted testing of a known familial 
variant, assuming sufficient analytic validity. Clinical utility can be demonstr ated by testing at -risk 
family members who have a close relative with a pathogenic variant. When a specific mitochondrial 
disease is present in the family that is severe enough to cause impairment and/or disability, genetic 
testing may impact reproductive decision making. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the 
technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.  
 
Supplemental Information  
Practice Guidelines and Position Statements 
Guidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in ‘Supplemental Information' if 
they were issued by, or jointly by, a US professional society, an international society with US 
representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given 
to guidelines that are informed by a systematic review, include strength of evidence ratings, and 
include a description of management of conflict of interest.

The Mitochondrial Medicine Society (2015) published a consensus statement on the diagnosis and 
management of mitochondrial disease. Most evidence was grade III or less (case-control, low-quality 
cohort studies, or expert opinion without an explicit critical appraisal) using the Oxford Centre for 
Evidence-Based Medicine criteria. Consensus recommendations were reported using the Delphi 
method. A subset of the consensus recommendations for DNA testing are as follows:

number of pathogenic point mutations.  
2. mtDNA deletion and duplication testing should be performed in cases of suspected 
mitochondrial disease via NGS of the mtDNA genome, especially in all patients undergoing 
a diagnostic tissue biopsy.  
a. If a single small deletion is identified using polymerase chain reaction -based analysis, 
then one should be cautious in associati ng these findings with a primary 
mitochondrial disorder.  
b. When multiple mtDNA deletions are noted, sequencing of nuclear genes involved in 
mtDNA biosynthesis is recommended.  
3. When considering nuclear gene testing in patients with likely primary mitochondrial  disease, 
NGS methodologies providing complete coverage of known mitochondrial disease genes is 
preferred. Single -gene testing should usually be avoided because mutations in different genes 
can produce the same phenotype. If no known mutation is identified  via known NGS gene 
panels, then whole exome sequencing should be considered."

*Investigational – A medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product is 
Investigational if the effectiveness has not been clearly tested and it has not been incorporated into 
standard medical practice. Any determination we make that a medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is Investigational will be based on a consideration of the following: 
A. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product can be 
lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
whether such approval has been granted at the time the medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is sought to be furnished; or 
B. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product requires 
further studies or clinical trials to determine its maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, safety, 
effectiveness, or effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or 
diagnosis, must improve health outcomes, according to the consensus of opinion amo ng 
experts as shown by reliable evidence, including: 
1. Consultation with technology evaluation center(s); 
2. Credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community; or 
3. Reference to federal regulations.

injury, disease or its symptoms, and that are: 
A. In accordance with nationally accepted standards of medical practice; 
B. Clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, level of care, site and duration, 
and considered effective for the patient's illness, injury or disease; and 
C. Not primarily for the personal comfort or convenience of the patient, physician or other 
health care provider, and not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services 
at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or 
treatment of that patient's illness, injury or disease. 
For these purposes, “nationally accepted standards of medical practice” means standards that are
