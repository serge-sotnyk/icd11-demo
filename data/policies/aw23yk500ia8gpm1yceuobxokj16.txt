Introduction  
Acute lympho cytic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer that starts from a certain  form of early white blood 
cells known as lymphocytes. One way of treating ALL is to do a hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant.  
Hematopoietic stem cells are cells that form within the bone marrow and can become many 
different types of blood cells. In a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, stem cells can be taken 
from a donor  or the patient before the patien t receives  high dose chemotherapy . The harvested 
stem cells are then given to the patient, just like in a transfusion. It is hoped that these new stem cells will then settle into the bone marrow and start producing normal blood cells.  If the 
hematopoietic stem cells are harvested from another person, it is called an allogeneic transplant. If the cells come from the patient, it is called an autologous stem cell transplant. This policy discusses when different types of hematopoietic stem cell transplants might be medically necessary to treat ALL. 
 
Note:    The Introduction section is for your general knowledg e and is not to be taken  as policy coverage criter ia. The 
rest of the policy uses specific words and concepts familiar to medical professionals. It is intend ed for 
providers . A provider can be a person, such as a doctor, nurse, psycholog ist, or dentist. A provider also can 
be a place where medical care is  given, l ike a hospital, clinic, or lab.  This policy informs them about when a 
service may be covered.

Relapse Risk Prognostic Factors  
Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  (ALL) 
Adverse prognostic factors in children include the following: age younger than one year or more 
than nine years, male sex, white blood cell count at presentation above 50,000/μL, hypodiploidy 
(<45 chromosomes), translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22 (t[9;22])  or BCR/ABL fusion, 
translocation involving chromosomes 4 and 11 (t[4;11])  or MLL/AF4 fusion, and ProB or T -
lineage immunophenotype. Several risk stratification schema exist, but, in general, the following 
findings help define children at high risk of relapse: ( 1) poor response to initial therapy including 
poor response to prednisone prophase defined as an absolute blast count of 1000/μL or greater, 
or poor treatment response to induction therapy at six weeks with high -risk having 1% or higher 
minimal residual disease measured by flow cytometry ; (2) all children with T -cell phenotype and 
(3) individuals with e ither the t(9;22) or t(4;11) regardless of early response measures.  
 
Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  (ALL) 
Risk factors for relapse are less well -defined  in adults , but an  individual with any of the following 
may be considered at high risk for relapse: age older than 35 years, leukocytosis at presentation 
of greater than 30,000/μL (B -cell lineage) or greater than 100,000/μL (T -cell lineage), “ poor 
prognosis” genetic abnormalities like the Philadelphia chromosome (t[ 9;22] ), extramedullary 
disease , and time to attain complete remission longer than 4 weeks.  
 Page | 5 of 18  ∞ Reduced Intensity Conditioning  
Some individual s for whom a conventional myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT)  could be curative may be co nsidered candidates for reduced intensity 
conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HCT. Such individuals include those whose age (typically older 
than 60 years) or co morbidities ( e.g., liver or kidney dysfunction, generalized debilitation, prior 
intensive che motherapy  including autologous or allogeneic HCT , low Karnofsky Performance 
Status) precludes use of a standard myeloablative conditioning regimen.  
Note:  Unless otherwise specified in the text of this Policy, it is assumed that the term “allogeneic 
HCT” re fers to the use of a myeloablative pretransplant conditioning regimen  and a non- self 
donor . 
The ideal allogeneic donors are human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -identical siblings, matched at 
the H LA-A, -B and DR  (antigen -D related)  loci on each arm of the chromo some 6 . Related 
donors mismatched at one locus are also considered suitable donors. A matched, unrelated 
donor identified through the National Marrow Donor Registry is typically the next option 
considered. Recently, there has been interest in haploidentica l donors, typically a parent or a 
child of the patient, where usually there is sharing of only three of the six major 
histocompatibility antigens. Most  individuals will have such a donor . The risk of morbidity ( e.g., 
graft -versus -host disease)  may be higher than with HLA -matched donors; however , as medical 
treatments improve, the risks of graft -versus -host disease with haploidentical donors are 
approaching those similar to HLA -matched donors.  
 
Benefit Application  
The following considerations may supersede this policy:  
• State mandates requiring coverage for autologous bone marrow transplantation offered as part of clinical trials of autologous bone marrow transplantation approved by the 
National Institutes of Health  (NIH) .  
• Some plans may participate in voluntary programs offering coverage for individuals 
participating in clinical trials approved by the N IH for cancer chemotherapies, including 
autologous bone marrow transplantation.  
• Some contracts  may include specific  conditions in which autologous bone marrow 
transplantation would be considered eligible for coverage.  Page | 6 of 18  ∞  
Evidence Review   
 
Description  
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease with different genetic variations 
resulting in distinct bio logic subtypes. Individual s are stratified to risk -adapted therapy 
according to certain clinical and genetic risk factors that predict an outcome. Therapy may include hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).  
 
Background  
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease with different genetic variations resulting in distinct biologic subtypes. Individual s are stratified by certain clinical and genetic risk 
factors that predict an outcome,  with risk -adapted therapy tailoring treatment based on the 
predicted risk of relapse.
1 Two of the most important factors predictive of risk are patient age 
and white blood cell count at diagnosis.1 Certain genetic characteristics of leukemic cells 
strongl y influence prognosis. Clinical and biologic factors predicting clinical outcomes and 
relapse risk are summarized in the Policy Criteria  section.2 
 
Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  
ALL is the most common cancer diagnosed in children; it represents ne arly 25% of cancers in 
children younger than 15 years.3 Remission of disease is now typically achieved with pediatric 
chemotherapy regimens in 98% of children with ALL, with up to 85% long -term survival rates. 
Survival rates have improved with the identification of effective drugs and combination 
chemotherapy through large, randomized  trials, integration of pre -symptomatic central nervous 
system prophylaxis, and intensification and risk -based stratification of treatment.2 The prognosis 
after the first relapse is related to the length of the original remission. For example, leukemia -
free survival is 40% to 50% for children whose first remission was longer than 3 years compared with 10% to 15% for those who relapse less than 3 years after treatment. Thus, HCT  may be a Page | 7 of 18  ∞ strong consideration in those with short remissions. At present, the comparative outcomes with 
autologous or allogeneic HCT (allo -HCT) are unknown.  
 
Adult ALL  
In adults, ALL accounts for 20% of acute leukemias . Between 60% and 80% of adults with ALL 
can be expected to achieve a complete response after induction chemotherapy; how ever, 
individuals who experience a relapse after remission usually die within 1 year .4 Differences in the 
frequency of genetic abnormalities that characterize adult ALL vs childhood ALL help, in part, 
explain differences in outcomes between the two groups. For example, the “good prognosis” genetic abnormalities, such as hyperdiploidy and translocation of chromosomes 12 and 21, are seen much less commonly in adult ALL, whereas they are some of the most com mon in 
childhood ALL. Conversely, “poor prognosis” genetic abnormalities such as the Philadelphia chromosome (translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22) are seen in 25% to 30% of adult ALL but infrequently in childhood ALL. Other adverse prognostic factors in adult ALL include age greater 
than 35 years, poor performance status, male sex, and leukocytosis at presentation of greater 
than 30 ,000/μL (B -cell lineage) or greater than 100 ,000/μL (T -cell lineage).  
 
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  
HCT is a procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are intravenously infused to restore bone 
marrow and immune function in cancer patients who receive bone marrow -toxic doses of 
cytotoxic drugs with or without whole -body radiotherapy. Hematopoietic stem cells may be 
obtain ed from the transplant recipient (autologous HCT) or a donor (allo -HCT). They can be 
harvested from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood shortly after delivery of 
neonates.  
Immunologic compatibility between infused hematopoietic stem cel ls and the recipient is not an 
issue in autologous HCT. In allogeneic stem cell transplantation, immunologic compatibility between donor and patient is a critical factor for achieving a successful outcome. Compatibility 
is established by typing of human le ukocyte antigens (HLA) using cellular, serologic, or 
molecular techniques. HLA refers to the gene complex expressed at the HLA -A, -B, and -DR 
(antigen -D related) loci on each arm of chromosome 6. An acceptable donor will match the 
patient at all or most of  the HLA loci.  
 Page | 8 of 18  ∞ Conditioning for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  
Conventional Conditioning  
The conventional (“classical”) practice of allo-HCT involves admini stration of cytotoxic agents 
(e.g., cyclophosphamide, busulfan) with or without total body irradiation at doses sufficient to 
cause bone marrow ablation  in the recipient. Intense conditioning regimens are limited to 
individuals whose health status is sufficient to tolerate the procedure of body irradiation at 
doses sufficient to cause bone marrow ablation in the recipient. The beneficial treatment effect 
of this procedure is due to a combination of the initial eradication of malignant cells and 
subsequent graft -versus -malignancy effect mediated by non -self-immunologic effector cells. 
While the slower graft- versus -malignancy effect is considered the potentially curative 
component, it may be overwhelmed by  substantial adverse effects . These include opportunistic 
infections secondary to loss of endogenous bone marrow function and organ da mage or failure 
caused by the cytotoxic drugs. Subsequent to graft infusion in allo -HCT, immunosuppressant  
drugs are required to minimize graft rejection and graft -versus -host disease  (GVHD) , which 
increases susceptibility to opportunistic infections.  
The success of autologous HCT is predicated on the potential  of cytotoxic chemotherapy , with 
or without radi otherapy,  to eradicate cancerous cells from the blood and bone marrow. This 
permits subsequent engraftment and repopulation of bone marrow with presumab ly normal 
hematopoietic stem cells obtained from the patient before undergoing bone marrow ablation. 
Therefore,  autologous HCT is typically performed as consolidation therapy when the individual’s 
disease is in complete remission.  Individual s who undergo autologous HCT are also susceptible 
to chemotherapy -related toxicities and opportunistic infections prior to engraftment, but not 
GVHD . 
 
Reduced  Intensity Conditioning for Allogeneic HCT  
RIC refers to the pretransplan t use of lower doses or less intense regimens of cytotoxic drugs or 
radiotherapy than are used in conventional full -dose myeloablative conditioning treatments. 
Although the definition of RIC is  variable , with numerous versions employed, all regimens seek 
to balance the competing effects of relapse due to residual disease  and non-relapse mortality . 
The goal of RIC is to reduce disease burden and to minimize associated treatment- related 
morbidity and non -relapse mortality in the period during which the beneficial graft -versus -
malignancy effect of allogeneic transplantation develops.  These RIC regimens  range  from being  
nearly totally myeloablative, to minimally myeloablative with lymphoablation, with intensity 
tailored to specific disease and patient condition.  Individual s who undergo RIC with allogeneic Page | 9 of 18  ∞ HCT initially demonstrate donor cell engraftment and bone marrow mixed chimerism. Most will 
subsequently convert to full- donor chimerism. For the purposes of this p olicy, the term 
“reduced -intensity condi tioning” will refer to all conditioning regimens intended to be non -
myeloablative.  
 
Summary of Evidence  
For individuals who have childhood ALL in first complete remission (CR1) at high risk of relapse, 
remission, or refractory ALL who receive autologous HCT, the evidence includes randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. The r elevant outcomes are overall survival, 
disease -specific survival, and treatment- related  mortality and morbidity. For children with high 
risk ALL in first complete remission (CR1) or with relapsed ALL, studies have suggested that HCT is associated with fewer relapses but higher death rates due to treatment -related toxicity. 
However, f or a subset of high -risk individual s in second complete remission or beyond or with 
relapsed disease, autologous HCT is a treatment option. This conclusion is supported by an 
evidence -based systematic review and position statement from the American Society  for Blood 
and Marrow Transplantation  (ASBMT) . The evidence is sufficient to determine that the 
technology results in an  improvement in the net health outcome.  
For individuals who  have childhood ALL in CR1  at high -risk of relapse, remission, or refractory 
ALL who receive allogeneic HCT (allo -HCT), the evidence includes RCTs and systematic reviews. 
The relevant outcomes are overall survival , disease -specific survival , and treatment -related 
mortality and morbidity. For children with high -risk ALL in CR1 or wi th relapsed ALL, studies 
have suggested that allo -HCT is associated with fewer relapses but higher death rates due to 
treatment -related toxicity. However, f or a subset of these high-risk individuals in second 
complete remission or beyond or with relapsed disease, allo -HCT is a treatment option. This 
conclusion is further supported by an evidence -based systematic review and position statement 
from the A SBMT . The evidence is sufficient to dete rmine that the technology results in a n 
improvement in the net health outcome.  
For individuals who have adult ALL in CR1, subsequent remission, or refractory ALL who receive 
autologous HCT, the evidence includes RCTs and systematic reviews. The relevant outcomes are 
overall survival, disease -specific survival, and treatment -related mortality and morbidity. Current 
evidence supports the use of autologous HCT for adults with high- risk ALL in CR1, whose health 
status is sufficient to tolerate the procedure. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a n improvement in the net health outcome.  Page | 10  of 18  ∞ For individuals who have adult ALL in first complete remission or subsequent remission, or 
refractory ALL who receive allo -HCT, the evidence incl udes RCTs , systematic reviews. The 
relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease- specific survival, and treatment -related mortality 
and morbidity. Current evidence supports the use of myeloablative allogeneic HCT (allo -HCT) for 
adults with any risk level ALL, whose health status is sufficient to tolerate the procedure. RIC 
allo-HCT may be considered for individual s who demonstrate complete marrow and 
extramedullary first or second remission and who could be expected to benefit from a myeloablative allo -HCT, but for medical reasons would not tolerate a myeloablative 
conditioning regimen. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a n 
improvement in the net health outcome.  
For individuals who have relapse d after a prior auto logous HCT for adult or childhood  ALL who 
receive allo -HCT, the evidence includes case series. The r elevant outcomes are overall survival, 
disease -specific survival, and treatment- related mortality and morbidity. Evidence reviews have 
identified only small  case series with short term follow -up which was considered i nadequate 
evidence of benefit. The evidence is suffi cient  to determine that the technology results in an 
improvement in the net health outcome .

Clinical Input Received from Physician Specialty Societies and Academic 
Medical Centers  
The purpose of the following information is to provide reference material. Inclusion does not 
imply endorsement or alignment with the policy  conclusions.  
While the various physician specialty societies and academic medical centers may collaborate with and make recommendations during this process, through the provision of appropriate reviewers , input received does not represent an endorsement or position statement by the 
physician specialty societies or academ ic medical ce nters, unless otherwise noted.  
 
2013 Input  
In response to requests, input was received from one  medical society, two academic medical 
centers, and three  physicians from Blue Distinction Centers while this policy was under review in 
2013. In ge neral, input supported most existing policy statements. However, most reviewers 
disagreed that allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo -HCT) is considered 
investigational to treat relapsing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after a prior autolo gous 
HCT in either children or adults. Given a scarcity of evidence on this topic, with no substantial 
trials likely to be forthcoming,  that allo-HCT after failed autologous HCT has been shown to be 
of clinical benefit in other hematologic malignancies and  is potentially curative, and that  RIC 
allo-HCT is considered medically necessary to treat relapsed or refractory ALL following failure 
of an auto -HCT, the policy statements were revised to medical necessity for  this indication in  
children and adults.  
 Page | 12  of 18  ∞ Practice Guidelines and Position Statements  
Guidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion if they were issued by, or 
jointly by, a US professional society, an international society with US representation, or National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines that are 
informed by a systematic review, include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description 
of man agement of conflict of interest.  
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network  
Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (v. 1.2022 ) for ALL indicate allo-HCT 
is appropriate for consolidation treatment of most poor -risk (e.g., the Philadelphia 
chromosome -positive , relapsed or  refractory) individual s with ALL.4 The guidelines state that for 
appropriately fit older adults with ALL who are achieving remission, “consideration of autologous or reduced -intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation may be appropriate.” In 
addition, the guidelines note that chronologic age is not a good surrogate for fitness for therapy and that patient should be evaluated on an individual basis.  
Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines  (v.1.2023 ) for pediatric ALL say that 
"Allogeneic HSCT has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in pediatric ALL patients with evidence of certain high -risk features and/or persistent disease. In addition, survival rates appear 
to be comparable regard less of the stem cell source (matched related, matched unrelated, cord 
blood, or haploidentical donor) ”. The guidelines state that the benefit of allo -HCT in infants is 
still controversial.
