Acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer
chemotherapy (HEC) including high-dose cisplatin
Nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy
(MEC)
Fosaprepitant dimeglumine (EmendÂ®) was approved by the FDA on January 25, 2008 for use in adultsÂ and pediatric
individuals 6Â months of age and older, on April 3, 2018 in combination with other antiemetic agents, for the prevention of:
Acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of HEC,Â including high-dose
cisplatin
Delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MECGranisetron (SustolÂ®)
 
was approved by the FDA on August 9, 2016 for use in combination with other antiemetics in adults
for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MECÂ or
anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens. The safety and effectiveness of
granisetron (SustolÂ®) have not been established in pediatric patients.
 
Rolapitant (VarubiÂ®) 
was approved by the FDA on October 25, 2017 
for use in combination with other antiemetic agents in
adults for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer

Description
Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may be a serious adverse effect of chemotherapy. There are three types of
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting:
Acute emesis: occurs within 1Â to 2Â hours of chemotherapy and usually peaks in 4Â to 6Â hours
Delayed emesis: occurs more than 24 hours after 
chemotherapy
Anticipatory emesis: occurs prior to 
chemotherapy
 
as a conditioned response in individuals who had previously
experienced significant nausea and vomiting during previous cycles
The risk of emesis without prophylaxis has been defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for
chemotherapy agents and their regimens. Based on theseÂ data, decisions regarding antiemetic prophylaxis (e.g., when to
initiate, which antiemetic agents to use) can be made:
Highly emetic: more than 90%Â risk of emesis
Moderately emetic: 30% to 90%Â risk of emesis
Low emetogenicity: 10% to 30%Â risk of emesis
Minimally emetic: less than 10%Â risk of emesis
Examples of options for 
chemotherapy-induced antiemetic prophylaxis include oral, injectable, transdermal, or intravenous
infusions of:
5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT
3
) rece
ptor antagonists (e.g., granisetron [KytrilÂ®, SustolÂ®], 
ondansetron [ZofranÂ®],
palonosetron [AloxiÂ®])
Neurokinin-1
 receptor (NK1R) antagonists (e.g., 
aprepitant [Cinvanti
â„¢
]
, 
aprepitant or fosaprepitant dimeglumine
[EmendÂ®], 
rolapitant [VarubiÂ®])
Dexamethasone
Olanzapine (ZyprexaÂ®)
APREPITANT (CINVANTI
â„¢
)
Aprepitant (Cinvanti
â„¢
) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on November 9, 2017 for use in
adults, in combination with other antiemetic agents, for the prevention of:
Acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer
chemotherapy (HEC) including high-dose cisplatin
Nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy
(MEC)
Aprepitant (Cinvanti
â„¢
) is a substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist. Aprepitant (Cinvanti
â„¢
) has been shown
to augment the antiemetic activity of dexamethasone and a 5-HT
3
â€“
receptor antagonist.
 
Aprepitant (Cinvanti
â„¢
) is an
intravenous infusion that is administered on Day 1 of chemotherapy over a period of 30 minutes, approximately 30 minutes
prior to chemotherapy. Aprepitant (Cinvanti
â„¢
) is administered in a regimen with dexamethasone and a 5-HT
3 
antagonist. 
FOSAPREPITANT DIMEGLUMINE (EMENDÂ®)
Fosaprepitant dimeglumine (EmendÂ®) was approved by the FDA on January 25, 2008 for use in adultsÂ 
and pediatric
individuals 6Â months of age and older, on April 3, 2018
 
in combination with other antiemetic agents, for the prevention of:
Acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of HECÂ including high-dose
cisplatin
Delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC
Fosaprepitant dimeglumine (EmendÂ®) 
is a prodrug of aprepitant, which is a substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor
antagonist. Aprepitant has been shown to augment the antiemetic activity of dexamethasone and a 5-HT
3
â€“
receptor
antagonist. 
Fosaprepitant dimeglumine (EmendÂ®)
 is an intravenous infusion that is 
administered on Day 1 of
chemotherapy over a period of 20 to 30 minutes, approximately 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Fosaprepitantdimeglumine (EmendÂ®)
 
is administered in a regimen with dexamethasone and a 5-HT
3 
antagonist. 
GRANISETRON (SUSTOLÂ®)
Granisetron (SustolÂ®) was approved by the 
FDA on August 9, 2016 for use in adults, in combination with other antiemetic
agents, for the prevention of 
acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MECÂ or
anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens. 
Granisetron (Sustol
Â®)
 
is a 
s
el
ective serotonin-3 (5-
HT
3
) receptor antagonist. 
When binding to 5-HT
3
 receptors, 
gra
nisetron
(SustolÂ®) inhibits the release of serotonin from its receptors and stops the process of vomiting.
Granisetron (SustolÂ®) is administered as a slow subcutaneous injection in combination with dexamethasone at least 30
minutes before the initiation of MEC or AC combination chemotherapy. It is administered on Day
Â 1
Â of chemotherapy and
not more frequently than once every 7
Â 
days because of the extend
ed-release properties of the formulation. 
ROL
APITANT (VARUBIÂ®)
Rolapitant (VarubiÂ®) was approved by the FDA on October 25, 2017 for use in combination with other antiemetic agents in
adults for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer
chemotherapy, including, but not limited to, highly emetogenic chemotherapy. 
Rolapitant (VarubiÂ®)
 
is a substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist.
 
Rolapitant (VarubiÂ®)
 
has been shown to
augment the antiemetic activity of dexamethasone and a 5-HT
3
â€“â€‹receptor antagonist. 
Rolapitant (VarubiÂ®
)
 is an
intravenous infusion that is administered on Day
Â 1
Â 
of chemotherapy over a period of 30 minutes, given 2Â hours prior to
the initiation of chemotherapy. 
Rolapitant (Va
rubiÂ®)
 is administered in a regimen with dexamethasone and a 5-HT
3
antagonist. 
OFF-LABEL INDICATION
There may be additional indications contained in the Policy section of this document due to evaluation of criteria highlighted
in the Companyâ€™s off-label policy, and/or review of clinical guidelines issued by leading professional organizations and
government entities.
