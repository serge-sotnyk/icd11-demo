I. POLICY  
 
It is the policy of UPMC Insurance Services Division  to provide payment for  Airway 
Secretion Clearance Devices  as a Durable Medical Equipment benefit under the capped 
rental  plan (refer to MP. PA.010 Durable Medical Equipment  - General  policy) when 
medically necessary and covered under the member’s specific benefit plan.    
 
All denials are based on medical necessity and appropriateness as determined by a 
UPMC Insurance Service s Division  Medical Director.  
 
 
II. DEFINITIONS  
 
Bronchiectasis  - a pulmonary condition caused by chronic injury to the lungs which 
results in the bronchial tubes of the lungs being permanently damaged, widened, and 
thickened.  These damaged air passages allow bacteria and mucus to build up and pool in 
the lungs, creating an optimal environment for inflammatio n, chronic infections , and 
blockage s of the airway .  Bronchiectasis is characterized clinically b y respiratory 
symptoms such as  shortness of breath, hemoptysis ( coughing up blood ) and difficulty 
clearing mucous from  the airways. Treatmen t is focused on airway  clearance  and may 
include  modalities such as bronchodilators , expectorants, hydration , and chest 
percussion /postural drainage therapy.  
 
Ciliated cells  - cells found in the respiratory tract that are covered in tiny hair -like 
projections known as cilia.  These cilia help debris and waste move along the surface of 
the cells.   
 
Cystic Fibrosis  (CF) - a genetic, potentially life -threatening disorder , that affects 
primarily the pulmonary and digestive systems .  A defective gene causes the cells that 
normally produce mucous, sweat , and digestive juices that are thin and slippery in 
consistency  to produce secretions that are thick and sticky.  Rather than acting as a 
lubricant, these thick and sticky secreted fluids block or clog tubes, ducts , and 
passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas  and leads to lung damage , increased  
infections and  the prevent ion of digestive proteins  reaching the intestines, affecting the 
body’s ability to absorb nutrients from food.

surfaces of organs and blood vessels throughout the body, as well as the inner surfaces of 
cavities in many internal organs.    
 
High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO ) - a non -pharmacologic airway 
clearance technique in which  external chest wall oscillations are applied to the torso 
using a fitted vest .  These vests, attached to a  pneumatic compressor, produce vibrations 
at variable frequencies and intensities in order to help loosen and thin mucus, and 
separate it from airway walls so it can be expectorated .  FDA -approved devices include  
(but are not limited to)  ThAIRapy Vest, The Vest™, SmartVest  Airway Clearance 
System , AffloVest ® and InCourage  System ™.  
 
Mechanical In sufflation -Exsufflation - a non -pharmacologic airway clearance  therapy 
in which the device gradually inflates the lungs (insufflation), followed by an immediate 
and abrupt change to negative pressure, which produces a rapid exhalation (exsufflation), 
which simulates a cough and thus moves secretions outward .  
 
Orophar ynx - the area located in the mouth  behind the oral cavity, below the soft palate

Oscillat ory Devices  - devices that are designed to move mucous and to clear airways by 
using airflow in a patterned movement back and forth at a c onsistent speed.   The 
oscillation may be intra or extra thoracic.  
 
Postural Drainage Therapy  - also frequently referred to as chest physi otherapy (CPT), 
uses gravity and percussion (clapping on the chest and/or back) to loosen the thick, sticky 
mucus in the lungs so it can be removed by coughing.

A. Medical Description /Background  
 
The secretion  of mucous  is the first -line defense against irritants that are inhaled i nto the 
lungs.  These inhaled irritants, such as soot, dust, microbes, and gases , can all damage the 
airway epithelium.  Effective clearance of inhaled particles requires continuous mucus 
trans port from the lower airways to the oropharynx.  Mucus transport is achieved by the 
action of the ciliated cells that cover the inner surface of the airways (mucociliary 
transport) and by expiratory airflow.                    
 
In patients with airway disease, mucociliary transport may be impaired and ai rflow 
transport (cough) may become the most important mucus transport mechanism.  
However, individuals with the impaired ability to cough due to respiratory muscle 
weakness or pulmonary restriction have difficulty clearing particle laden secretions from 
the lungs .  
A number of conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), mucociliary disorders, neuromuscular disease s (i.e., 
amyo trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) , muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis (MS) an d 
myasthenia gravis), spinal cord injuries  and metabolic disorders can result in inadequate 
airway clearance, either because of increased volume of secretions or increased viscosity 
of secretions.   These secretions accumulate in the bronchial tree, occludi ng small 
passages and interfering with adequate gas exchange in the lungs.   They also serve as a n 
environment  for pathogens, leading to a higher risk for chronic infection and 
deterioration of lung function.                                               
 
When coughing alone cannot adequately clear secretions, other therapies are used. 
Standard treatment for retained airway secretions may include chest physiotherapy, 
airway clearance devices, medications, mechanical percussors, and positive expiratory 
press ure (PEP) masks.   
 
Conventional chest physiotherapy (CPT) has been demonstrated to improve respiratory 
function and has traditionally been accomplished through the use of percussion and 
postural drainage.   Postural drainage and percussion techniques are u sually taught to care 
providers so that the therapy may be continued at home when needed.  Due to the daily 
required need for this labor -intensive  intervention , even a trained caregiver may struggle 
with compliance with the recommended treatment plan.  To improve compliance and 
allow patients to independently manage their disease, HFCWC/high -frequency chest wall 
oscillation (HFCWO) devices have been developed to improve mucociliary clearance and 
lung function.  
 
High -frequency chest wall oscillation device s (HFCWO) deliver chest physiotherapy by 
means of pulsed pressure, helping individuals  mobilize airway secretions.   HFCWO  
works by producing vibrations at variable frequencies and intensities that assist in

© 2022 UPMC All Rights Reserved  loosening and thinning the mucus adherent to the br onchial walls.  HFCWO  consist s of 
two components: a vest worn by the individual,  and a pneumatic air -pulse generator that 
rapidly inflates and deflates the vest , causing the chest wall to oscillate .  Some vests, 
including the Monarch and SmartVest, also fe ature Bluetooth connectivity that allows for 
monitoring of treatment adherence.  For individuals who fail to respond to standard 
treatments to adequately mobilize retained secretions, HFCWO may be appropriate.  
 
Mechanical percussors are electrical devices used to provide clapping or percussion to the 
external chest wall.   These devices deliver consistent, programmable deep pulses , with 
the vibration resulting in the mobilization and clearance of airway secretions .  The 
machine is moved over the patient’s chest while the patients assume  a variety  of drainage 
positions.  Examples of FDA -approved percussors include the Fluid Flo Model 2500 
Percussor, Electro Flo5000, and the Frequencer V2.  
 
Positive expiratory pressu re (PEP) devices promote mucus clearance by preventing 
airway closure and increasing collateral ventilation.  PEP pushes air into the lungs, holds 
the airways open, and prevents them from closing.  The patient inspires normally but 
expires harder against r esistance.  Examples of FDA -approved PEP devices include 
TheraP ep, and Pari Pep.  
 
Oscillatory PEP devices combine high -frequency airflow oscillations with PEP to create 
oscillations  of endobronchial pressure and expiratory airflow that vibrate the airway w alls 
and loosen mucous.  These handheld devices may be gravity -dependent or independent .  
Examples of FDA -approved oscillatory PEP devices include the gravity -dependent 
device Flutter , and gravity -independent devices Acapella , Aerobika, and Quake .   
 
Mecha nical insufflator -exsufflators, also known as cough assist therapy, are portable 
electric devices that alternatively apply positive and rapid negative pressure to a patient’s 
airway.  These devices create a rapid shift in pressure which simulates cough and  
increases secretion clearance.  Examples of FDA -approved mechanical insufflator -
exsufflators include CoughAssist  and VitalCough.  
 
Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) is a modification on intermittent positive -
pressure breathing with high -frequency bursts of air/oxygen into the lungs while 
simultaneously delivering therapeutic aerosols .  The combination of vibration, aerosol, 
and pressure loosens secretions, stimulates cough, and leads to sputum production.  
Although typically used during hospitalization, there has been some proposal for home 
use.  Examples of home -use devices include the HC Impulsator.  At this time, there is a 
paucity of peer -reviewed evidence to suggest that home use of such devices is medically 
necessary.
