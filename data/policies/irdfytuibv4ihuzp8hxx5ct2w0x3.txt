Policy Guidelines  
Organ Rejection After Solid Organ Transplant 
A regimen of immunosuppressive therapy is standard of care for the treatment of solid organ 
rejection. Therefore, refractory rejection is defined as rejection that fails to respond adequately to a 
standard regimen of immunosuppressive therapy. 
 
Recurrent allograft rejection is defined as having at least 2 rejection episodes after standard 
immunosuppressive therapy. 
 
There is no standard schedule for extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), and reported schedules vary 
by the organ type. However, most reported cardiac and lung schedules initiate therapy with 2 
consecutive days of ECP in month 1, followed by biweekly therapy on 2 consecutive days in months 
2 and 3, then monthly on 2 consecutive days in months 4 through 6. 
 
Graft-Versus-Host Disease 
Methylprednisolone is considered first-line treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). 
For chronic GVHD, an alternating regimen of cyclosporine and prednisone is commonly used; other 
therapies include antithymocyte globulin, corticosteroid monotherapy, and cytotoxic 
immunosuppressive drugs such as procarbazine, cyclophosphamide, or azathioprine. Therefore, 
refractory disease is defined as GVHD that fails to respond adequately to a trial of any of these 
therapies. 
 
Treatment schedule and duration of ECP for GVHD have not been optimally defined. Guidelines 
and consensus statements have generally recommended 1 cycle (ie, ECP on 2 consecutive days)

weekly for acute GVHD and every 2 weeks for chronic GVHD. Treatment duration is based on 
clinical response; discontinuation is generally recommended for no or minimal response. 
 
Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma Staging 
Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma staging is based on the tumor, node, metastases (TNM) classification 
system (see Table PG1).

Sézary Syndrome 
According to the World Health Organization-European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer, Sézary syndrome is defined by the triad of erythroderma, generalized lymphadenopathy, 
and the presence of neoplastic T cells (Sézary cells) in the skin, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. 
The International Society of Cutaneous Lymphomas recommends an absolute Sézary cell count of 
at least 1000 cells per cubic millimeter, in the presence of immunophenotypical abnormalities 
(CD4/CD8 ratio >10; loss of any or all of the T-cell antigens CD2, CD3, CD4, and CD5; or both), 
or the demonstration of a T-cell clone in the peripheral blood by molecular or cytogenetic methods. 
 
Background/Overview  
Organ Rejection Treatment After Solid Organ Transplant 
The standard treatment for organ transplant rejection is immunosuppression, with the particular 
regimen dictated by the organ being transplanted. As organ transplantation success rates have 
improved, more patients are facing the morbidity and mortality associated with immunosuppressive 
therapies developed to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. Immunosuppressive therapies are 
used to lower the respon siveness of the recipient’s immune system, decreasing the chance of

rejection. Unfortunately, portions of the immune system responsible for the prevention of viral, 
fungal, and bacterial infections also are affected. This can, in turn, lead to serious infections, 
including opportunistic infections. 
 
Although first approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), extracorporeal 
photopheresis (ECP) has more recently been used as a supplement to conventional therapies in the 
area of solid organ transplantation. Reports of the successful use of ECP in human cardiac transplant 
recipients were published in 1992 and use in other transplant patients followed. Although the specific 
mechanism of action of ECP is unknown, the reinfusion of treated leukocytes seems specifically to 
suppress the patient’s immune response to the donor organ, although maintaining the body’s ability 
to respond to other antigens. The specificity of ECP to target the immune response to the transplanted 
organ allows ECP to decrease organ rejection without an increased risk of infection, common with 
immunosuppressive drugs. 
 
Graft-Versus-Host Disease 
Given that graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an immune-mediated disease, ECP can be used to 
treat GVHD after a prior allogeneic cell transplant. In fact, GVHD can be categorized in 2 ways: (1) 
as an acute disease, occurring within the first 100 days after the infusion of allogeneic cells; or (2), 
as a chronic disease, which develops sometime after 100 days. Acute GVHD is commonly graded 
from I to IV, ranging from mild disease, which is characterized by a skin rash without the 
involvement of the liver or gut, to grades III and IV, which are characterized by generalized 
erythroderma, elevated bilirubin levels, or diarrhea. Grade III acute GVHD is considered severe, and 
grade IV is considered life-threatening. Chronic GVHD typically presents with more diverse 
symptomatology resembling autoimmune diseases such as progressive systemic sclerosis, systemic 
lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid arthritis. Chronic GVHD may affect the mouth, eyes, respiratory 
tract, musculoskeletal system, and peripheral nerves, as well as the skin, liver, or gut-the usual sites 
of acute GVHD. 
 
Autoimmune Disease 
The use of ECP as a treatment of autoimmune disease is based on the premise that pathogenic 
lymphocytes form an expanded clone of cells, which are damaged when exposed to ultraviolet light 
in the presence of agent 8-methoxypsoralen. It is hypothesized that the resulting damage induces a 
population of circulating suppressor T cells targeted against the light-damaged cells. It is further 
hypothesized that these suppressor T cells are targeted at a component of the cell that is common to  
 
Extracorporeal Photopheresis

the entire clone of abnormal cells (ie, not just the light-sensitized cells), thus inducing a systemic 
effect. However, although scleroderma and other autoimmune diseases are associated with the 
presence of circulating autoantibodies, it is unknown how these antibodies are related to the 
pathogenesis of the disease. As discussed in this medical policy, photopheresis is not associated with 
consistent changes in autoantibody levels. 
 
T-Cell Lymphoma 
 
Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma 
According to the National Cancer Institute, CTCL is a neoplasia of malignant T lymphocytes that 
initially presents as skin involvement. CTCL is extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of 
approximately 0.4 per 100000 annually, but because most are low-grade malignancies with long 
survival, the overall prevalence is much higher. Two CTCL variants, mycosis fungoides, and the 
Sézary syndrome account for approximately 60% and 5% of new cases of CTCL, respectively. 
 
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is included in the Revised European-American Lymphoma 
classification as a group of low-grade T-cell lymphomas, which should be distinguished from other 
T-cell lymphomas that involve the skin, such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell 
lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (usually with systemic involvement), or subcutaneous 
panniculitis T-cell lymphoma. In addition, a number of benign or very indolent conditions can be 
confused with mycosis fungoides, further complicating diagnosis.

Mycosis fungoides typically progresses from an eczematous patch/plaque stage, covering less than 
10% of the body surface (T1), to a plaque stage, covering 10% or more of the body surface (T2), 
and finally to tumors (T3) that frequently undergo necrotic ulceration. Sézary syndrome is an 
advanced form of mycosis fungoides with generalized erythroderma (T4) and peripheral blood 
involvement (B1) at presentation. The cytologic transformation from a low-grade lymphoma to a 
high-grade lymphoma sometimes occurs during the course of these diseases and is associated with 
poor prognosis. A common cause of death during the tumor phase is sepsis from Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus caused by chronic skin infection with staphylococcus species 
and subsequent systemic infections. 
 
The natural history of mycosis fungoides is typically indolent. Symptoms may present for long 
periods of time (mean, 2 to 10 years) as waxing and waning cutaneous eruptions. The prognosis of

patients with mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome is based on the extent of disease at presentation 
and its stage. Lymphadenopathy and involvement of peripheral blood and viscera increase in 
likelihood with worsening cutaneous involvement and define poor prognostic groups. Median 
survival after diagnosis varies by stage. Median survival in patients with stage IA disease exceeds 
20 years, with most deaths in this group typically unrelated to mycosis fungoides. In contrast, median 
survival in patients with stage III or IV disease is less than 5 years; more than 50% of these patients 
die of their disease. 
 
Appropriate therapy of CTCL depends on a variety of factors, including stage, the patient's overall 
health, and the presence of symptoms. In general, therapies can be categorized into topical and 
systemic treatments that include ECP. In contrast to more conventional lymphomas, CTCL is usually 
not curable (unless caught in its earliest stages). Thus, systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy is avoided 
except for advanced-stage cases. Partial or complete remission is achievable, although most patients 
require lifelong treatment and monitoring.  
 
FDA or Other Governmental Regulatory Approval  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Two photopheresis systems (Therakos; now Mallinckrodt) were approved by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) through the premarket approval process. Both systems are approved for 
use in ultraviolet-A irradiation treatment, in the presence of the photoactive drug 8-methoxypsoralen, 
of extracorporeally circulating leukocyte-enriched blood, in the palliative treatment of skin 
manifestations of CTCL, in persons who have not been responsive to other forms of treatment. The 
2 systems are: 
• UVAR®‡ XTS Photopheresis System (FDA approved in 1987). 
• CELLEX®‡ (FDA approved in 2009). 
 
Photoactive 8-methoxypsoralen (UVADEX®‡; Therakos; now Mallinckrodt) is FDA approved for 
extracorporeal administration with the UVAR®‡ XTS or CELLEX®‡ Photopheresis System in the 
palliative treatment of the skin manifestations of CTCL unresponsive to other forms of treatment. 
 
The use of either Therakos photopheresis system or UVADEX®‡ for other conditions is off-label.

Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer-reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines. 
 
Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a leukapheresis-based immunomodulatory procedure that 
involves the following 3 steps: (1) the patient’s blood is collected into a centrifuge system that 
separates the leukocyte-rich portion (buffy coat) from the rest of the blood; (2) the photosensitizer 
agent 8-methoxypsoralen is added to the lymphocyte fraction, which is then exposed to ultraviolet-
A (320-400 nm wavelength) light at a dose of 1 to 2 J/cm2; and (3) the light-sensitized lymphocytes 
are reinfused into the patient. The use of ECP has been investigated for patients needing treatment 
for organ rejection after solid organ transplant, graft-versus -host disease (GVHD), autoimmune 
diseases, and T-cell lymphoma. 
 
Summary of Evidence 
 
Graft Rejection After Solid Organ Transplant 
 
Heart Transplant  
For individuals who are heart transplant recipients who experience acute graft rejection refractory 
to immunosuppression who receive ECP, the evidence includes a small randomized controlled trial 
(RCT). Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), change in disease status, and treatment-related 
mortality and morbidity. The small RCT, while suggesting similar outcomes for ECP and 
corticosteroids, is insufficient to permit conclusions on the utility of ECP. Studies with more patients 
and longer follow-up are needed. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results 
in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals who are heart transplant recipients who experience recurrent and/or refractory graft 
rejection who receive ECP, the evidence includes a comparative study and small case series. 
Relevant outcomes are OS, change in disease status, and treatment-related mortality and morbidity. 
Current evidence is consistent on the beneficial effect of ECP for cardiac transplant patients with

graft rejection refractory to standard therapy. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the 
technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals who are heart transplant recipients who require prophylaxis to prevent graft rejection 
who receive ECP, the evidence includes a small RCT and a prospective pilot study. Relevant 
outcomes are OS, change in disease status, and treatment-related mortality and morbidity. The small 
randomized trial is insufficient to permit conclusions on the utility of ECP. The pilot study was non-
comparative and evaluated outcomes in high-risk cardiac transplant patients. Studies with more 
patients and longer follow-up are needed. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the 
technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
Lung Transplant  
For individuals who are lung transplant recipients who experience acute graft rejection who receive 
ECP, the evidence includes a small retrospective study and small case series. Relevant outcomes are 
OS, change in disease status, and treatment-related mortality and morbidity. Current evidence is very 
limited and any conclusions drawn lack certainty. A prospective, randomized trial is needed 
specifically evaluating the treatment of patients with acute graft rejection. The evidence is 
insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
For individuals who are lung transplant recipients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) 
refractory to corticosteroids who receive ECP, the evidence includes a prospective study and 
numerous retrospective analyses. Relevant outcomes are OS, change in disease status, and treatment-
related mortality and morbidity. Studies have shown inconsistent results across BOS grades. 
Prospective RCTs are necessary with analyses stratified by syndrome grade. The evidence is 
insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
Liver Transplant  
For individuals who are liver transplant recipients who experience graft rejection and receive ECP, 
the evidence includes a small nonrandomized study, a retrospective study, and a case series. Relevant 
outcomes are OS, change in disease status, and treatment-related mortality and morbidity. Current 
evidence does not permit conclusions on the utility of ECP in this population. There is a need for 
RCTs comparing immunosuppressive therapy alone with immunosuppressive therapy with ECP. 
The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net 
health outcome.

Kidney Transplant  
For individuals who are kidney transplant recipients who experience recurrent graft rejection who 
receive ECP, the evidence includes a small prospective study and numerous case reports. Relevant 
outcomes are OS, change in disease status, and treatment-related mortality and morbidity. Current 
evidence does not permit conclusions on the effect of ECP on net health outcome. There is a need 
for RCTs comparing immunosuppressive therapy with and without the use of ECP and examining 
histologic confirmation of treatment response. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the 
technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
Graft-Versus-Host Disease 
For individuals who have acute or chronic GVHD refractory to medical treatment who receive ECP, 
the evidence includes systematic reviews, a randomized study, retrospective studies, and case series. 
Relevant outcomes are OS, change in disease status, and treatment-related mortality and morbidity. 
Current evidence has consistently shown that ECP reduces the incidence of GVHD that is 
unresponsive to standard therapy. Additionally, there is a lack of other treatment options for these 
patients; adverse events related to ECP are minimal; and, if there is a response to ECP, patients may 
be able to reduce or discontinue treatment with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. 
The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net 
health outcome. 
 
Other Indications, Not Related To Solid Organ Transplant 
 
Autoimmune Disease 
For individuals who have autoimmune diseases (eg, cutaneous or visceral manifestations of 
autoimmune diseases including but not limited to scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, 
rheumatoid arthritis, pemphigus, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, autoimmune bullous 
disorders, severe atopic dermatitis, and Crohn's disease) who receive ECP, the evidence includes 
isolated RCTs, small prospective and retrospective studies, and case reports. Relevant outcomes are 
OS, change in disease status, and treatment-related mortality and morbidity. The current literature 
assessing the various autoimmune diseases is not sufficiently robust to support conclusions. The 
evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health 
outcome.

Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma 
For individuals who have advanced-stage (stage III or IV) cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who 
receive ECP, the evidence includes a systematic review and numerous small case series. Relevant 
outcomes are OS, change in disease status, and treatment-related mortality and morbidity. Evidence 
from these small case series has shown a favorable response to ECP treatment and an increase in 
survival in a proportion of these patients. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology 
results in an improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals who have refractory or progressive early-stage (stage I or II) CTCL who receive 
ECP, the evidence includes a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are OS, change in disease status, 
and treatment-related mortality and morbidity. Given the unfavorable prognosis for patients with 
early-stage CTCL that progresses on nonsystemic therapies, the relative lack of adverse events with 
ECP compared with other systemic treatments, and the good response rates often observed with 
ECP, this therapy is an option for those with refractory or progressive early-stage CTCL. The 
evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health 
outcome.

Graft-Versus-Host Disease 
 
Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease 
 
American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation 
In 2012, evidence-based recommendations from the American Society of Blood and Marrow 
Transplantation advised that ECP cannot be considered superior to horse antithymocyte globulin for 
the treatment of acute GVHD. This conclusion was based on older studies. 
 
Acute and Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease 
 
National Cancer Institute 
In its guidelines on childhood hematopoietic cell transplantation, the National Cancer Institute listed 
ECP as a second-line treatment for patients with acute GVHD resistant to first-line 
methylprednisolone. For chronic GVHD therapy, the guidelines recommended that steroids are first-
line therapy, but steroid-sparing approaches, including ECP, are being developed. In this setting, 
ECP has shown “some efficacy in some patients.”  
 
Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines on primary cutaneous lymphomas (v.2.2022  ) 
list the use of ECP as a category 2A treatment alone or in combination with other agents as first-line 
systemic therapy for advanced (stages III-IV) disease, as well as for patients with earlier stage 
mycosis fungoides with Sézary syndrome involvement. The guidelines add that ECP may be more 
appropriate as systemic therapy in patients with or at risk of blood involvement (B1 or B2).

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations 
Not applicable. 
 
Medicare National Coverage 
 
Solid Organ Transplants 
Effective 2006, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) concluded that ECP is 
reasonable and necessary for persons with “acute cardiac allograft rejection whose disease is 
refractory to standard immunosuppressive drug treatment”.  
 
Effective 2012, CMS also provided coverage for ECP for the treatment of “bronchiolitis obliterans 
syndrome (BOS) following lung allograft transplantation only when extracorporeal photopheresis is 
provided under a clinical research study” that meets certain conditions.  
 
Graft-Versus-Host Disease 
Effective 2006, CMS provided coverage of ECP for patients with chronic GVHD “whose disease is 
refractory to standard immunosuppressive drug treatm ent.”  
 
Autoimmune Disorders 
There are no national coverage decisions on the use of ECP for the treatment of autoimmune disease. 
 
Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma 
Effective 1988, CMS provided coverage for ECP as “palliative treatment of skin manifestations of 
cutaneous T- cell lymphoma that has not responded to other therapy.”

*Investigational – A medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product is 
Investigational if the effectiveness has not been clearly tested and it has not been incorporated into 
standard medical practice. Any determination we make that a medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is Investigational will be based on a consideration of the following: 
A. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product can be 
lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
whether such approval has been granted at the time the medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is sought to be furnished; or 
B. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product requires 
further studies or clinical trials to determine its maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, safety, 
effectiveness, or effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or 
diagnosis, must improve health outcomes, according to the consensus of opinion among 
experts as shown by reliable evidence, including: 
1. Consultation with technology evaluation center(s); 
2. Credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community; or 
3. Reference to federal regulations.

**Medically Necessary (or “Medical Necessity”) - Health care services, treatment, procedures, 
equipment, drugs, devices, items or supplies that a Provider, exercising prudent clinical judgment, 
would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, evaluating, diagnosing or treating an illness, 
injury, disease or its symptoms, and that are: 
A. In accordance with nationally accepted standards of medical practice; 
B. Clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, level of care, site and duration, 
and considered effective for the patient's illness, injury or disease; and 
C. Not primarily for the personal comfort or convenience of the patient, physician or other 
health care provider, and not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services 
at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or 
treatment of that patient's illness, injury or disease. 
For these purposes, “nationally accepted standards of medical practice” means standards that are 
based on credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community, Physician Specialty Society recommendations and 
the views of Physicians practicing in relevant clinical areas and any other relevant factors.
