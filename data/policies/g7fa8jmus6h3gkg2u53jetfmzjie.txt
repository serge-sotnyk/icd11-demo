DESCRIPTION:  
The autonomic nervous system (A NS) controls physiologic processes  that are not under conscious 
control. ANS disorders, also called dysau tonomias, are heterogeneous in etiology, clinical symptoms, 
and severity. ANS disorders can be limited and focal, such as patients with isolated neuroc ardiogenic 
syncope or idiopathic p almar hyperhidrosis. At the other extreme, some ANS disorders can be 
widespread and severely disabling, such as multiple systems atrophy, which leads to widespread and 
severe autonomic failure.  
ANS testing consists of a ba ttery of tests that evaluate the i ntegrity and function of the ANS. These tests 
are intended as adjuncts to the clinical examination in the diagnosis of ANS disorders. ANS testing is 
performed in a dedicated ANS testing laborat ory. Testing in a dedicated laboratory should be performed 
unde r closely controlled conditions, and results should be interpreted by an individual with expertise in 
ANS testing. Testing using automated devices with results interpreted by computer software has not 
been validated and th us has the potential to lead to er roneous results.  
POSITION STATEMENT:  
Autonomic nervous system (ANS) tes ting, consisting of a battery of tests in several domains, meets the 
definition of medical necessity  when ALL of the follo wing criteria are met:  
A. Signs and/or symptoms * of autonomic dysf unction are present; AND  
B. A definitive diagnosis cannot be made from cli nical examination and routine laboratory testing 
alone; AND  
C. Diagnosis of the suspected autonomic disorder will lead to a c hange in management or will 
eliminat e the need for further test ing. Note:  Although there is not a standard battery of tests that are p art of ANS testing, a full battery of 
testing generally consists of individual tests in three categories : 1. Cardiovagal f unction (heart rate [HR] 
variability, HR response to deep breat hing and Valsalva  maneuver ); 2. Vasomotor adrenergic function 
(blood pr essure [BP] response to standing, Valsalva  maneuver , and hand grip, tilt table testing); 3. 
Sudomotor function ( Quantitati ve Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test  (QSART ), Thermoregulatory Sweat T est 
(TST), silastic sweat imprin t, sympathetic skin response, electroch emical sweat conductance ). At least  
one test in each category is usually performed. More than one test from a category wil l often be 
included in a batt ery of tests, but the incremental value of using multiple tests in a category  is not 
known.  
*(Symptoms of  autonomic disorders can be varied, based on the etiology and location of dysfunction. 
Cardiovascular manifestations are o ften prominent. Involvement o f the cardiovascular system causes  
abnormalities in heart rate control and vascular dynamics. Orthostatic  hypotension and other 
manifestations of BP lability can occur, causing weakness, dizziness, and syncope. Resting tachycar dia 
and an inability to appro priately increase heart rate in re sponse to exertion leads to exercise 
intolerance.)  
Autonomic nervous sy stem testing is considered experimental or investigational in all other situations 
when criteria are not met, including bu t not limited to the evaluati on of the following conditions : 
 chronic fatigue syndrome  
 fibromyalgia  
 anxiety an d other psychological di sorders  
 sleep apnea  
 allergic conditions  
 hypertension  
 screen ing of asymptomatic individuals  
 monitoring progression of di sease or response to treatment.  
The evidence is insufficient to de termine the effects of the technology on health outcomes.  
The following  tests are generally considered to have uncertain value in ANS testing and are considered 
experimental or investigational  when used in ANS testing:  
 Pupi llography  
 Pupil edge light cycle  
 Gastric emptying tests  
 Cold pressor test  
 Quantitative direct and indir ect testing of sudomotor function (QDIRT) test 
 Plasma catecholamine levels  
 Skin vasomotor testing   The ANSAR® test. 
The evi dence is insufficient to determ ine the effects of the technolog y on health outcomes.  
Autonomic nervous system testing using portable a utomated devices is considered experimental or  
investigational for all indications. These devices have not been validated and have a greater potential to  
lead to erroneous results.
