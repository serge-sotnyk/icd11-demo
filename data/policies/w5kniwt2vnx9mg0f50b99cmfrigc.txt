Because of the differing benefits and risks of in utero versus postnatal surgeries, parents should make 
an informed choice between the procedures.  
 
Background/Overview  
Most fetal anatomic malformations are best managed after birth. However, advances in methods of 
prenatal diagnosis, particularly prenatal ultrasound, have led to a new understanding of the natural 
history and physiologic outcomes of certain congenital anomalies. Fetal surgery is the logical extension 
of these diagnostic advances, related in part to technical advancement in anesthesia, tocolysis, and 
hysterotomy.  
 
This policy will pertain to fetal surgery performed for the following clinical conditions. 
 
Fetal Urinary Tract Obstruction  
Although few cases of prenatally diagnosed urinary tract obstruction require prenatal intervention, 
bilateral obstruction can lead to distention of the urinary bladder and is often associated with serious 
disease such as pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to oligohydramnios. Therefore, fetuses with bilateral 
obstruction, oligohydramnios, adequate renal function reserve, and no other lethal or chromosomal 
abnormalities may be candidates for fetal surgery. The most common surgical approach is 
decompression through percutaneous placement of a shunt or stent. Vesicoamniotic shunting bypasses 
the obstructed urinary tract, permitting fetal urine to flow into the amniotic space. The goals of shunting 
are to protect the kidneys from increased pressure in the collecting system and to assure adequate 
amniotic fluid volume for lung development. 
 
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia 
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia results from abnormal development of the diaphragm, which permits 
abdominal viscera to enter the chest, frequently resulting in hypoplasia of the lungs. CDH can vary 
widely in severity, depending on the size of the hernia and the timing of herniation. For example, late 
herniation after 25 weeks of gestation may be adequately managed postnatally. In contrast, liver 
herniation into the chest before 25 weeks of gestation is associated with a poor prognosis, and these 
fetuses have been considered candidates for fetal surgery. Temporary tracheal occlusion using a balloon 
is being evaluated for the treatment of CDH. Occluding the trachea of a fetus prevents the normal efflux 
of fetal lung fluid, which results in a build-up of secretions in the pulmonary tree and increases the size 
of the lungs, gradually pushing abdominal viscera out of the chest cavity and back into the abdominal

cavity. It is believed that this, in turn, will promote better lung maturation. Advances in imaging have 
resulted in the ability to detect less severe lesions, which has resulted in a decrease in mortality rates for 
defects detected during pregnancy. Due to these changes over time, concurrent controls are needed to 
adequately compare pre- and postnatal approaches. 
 
Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation) or 
Bronchopulmonary Sequestration 
Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM), also referred to as congenital pulmonary airway 
malformations, and bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) are the 2 most common congenital cystic 
lung lesions and share the characteristic of a segment of lung being replaced by abnormally developing 
tissue. CCAMs can have connections to the pulmonary tree and contain air, while BPS does not connect 
to the airway and has blood flow from the aorta rather than the pulmonary circulation. In more severe 
cases, the malformations can compress adjacent normal lung tissue and distort thoracic structure. CCAM 
lesions typically increase in size in mid-trimester and then in the third trimester either involute or 
compress the fetal thorax, resulting in hydrops in the infant and sometimes mirror syndrome (a severe 
form of preeclampsia) in the mother. Mortality is close to 100% when lesions are associated with fetal 
hydrops (abnormal accumulation of fluid in 2 or more fetal compartments). These patients may be 
cand idates for prenatal surgical resection of a large mass or placement of a thoracoamniotic shunt to 
decompress the lesion.  
 
Sacrococcygeal Teratoma 
Sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) is both a neoplasm with autonomous growth and a malformation made 
up of multiple tissues foreign to the region of origin and lacking organ specificity. It is the most common 
tumor of the newborn and generally carries a good prognosis in infants born at term. However, in utero 
fetal mortality approaches 100% with large or vascular tumors, which may become larger than the rest 
of the fetus. In this small subset, SCT is associated with fetal hydrops, which is related to high output 
heart failure secondary to arteriovenous shunting. In some cases, mothers of fetuses with hydrops can 
develop mirror syndrome.  
 
Myelomeningocele 
Myelomeningocele is a neural tube defect in which the spinal cord forms abnormally and is left open, 
exposing the meninges and neural tube to the intrauterine environment. Myelomeningocele is the most 
common cause of spina bifida, and depending on the location, results in varying degrees of neurologic 
impairment to the legs and bowel and bladder function, brain malformation (ie, hindbrain herniation),

cognitive impairment, and disorders of cerebrospinal fluid circulation, ie, hydrocephalus requiring 
placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Traditional treatment consists of surgical repair after term 
delivery, primarily to prevent infection and further neurologic dysfunction. Fetal surgical repair to cover 
the exposed spinal canal has been proposed as a means of preventing the deleterious exposure to the 
intrauterine environment with the hope of improving neurologic function and decreasing the incidence 
of other problems related to the condition. 
 
Cardiac Malformations 
In utero interventions are being investigated for several potentially lethal congenital heart disorders, 
including critical aortic stenosis with evolving HLHS, HLHS with intact atrial septum, and critical 
pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia. Critical pulmonary stenosis or atresia with intact ventricular 
septum is characterized by a very narrow pulmonary valve without a connection between the right and 
left ventricles. Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum can evolve into right ventricular 
hypoplasia; fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty may result in biventricular circulation. Critical aortic stenosis 
with impending HLHS is a very narrow aortic valve that develops early during gestation that may result 
in HLHS, a complex spectrum of cardiac anomalies characterized by hypoplasia of the left ventricle and 
aorta, with atretic, stenotic, or hypoplastic atrial and mitral valves. In utero aortic balloon valvuloplasty 
relieves aortic stenosis with the goal of preserving left ventricular growth and halting the progression to 
HLHS. HLHS with intact trial septum is a variant of HLHS that occurs in about 22% of all HLHS cases 
in which blood flow across the foramen ovale is restricted, leading to left atrial hypertension and damage 
to the pulmonary vasculature, parenchyma, and lymphatics. For HLHS with intact atrial septum, fetal 
balloon atrial septostomy is designed to reduce the left atrial restriction.

The evidence related to the use of fetal surgery is limited by the rarity of the conditions treated and the 
extremely specialized nature of the procedures, although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been 
conducted for several conditions. The literature related to fetal surgery has been summarized in several 
systematic reviews. In addition to the 1998 and 1999 TEC Assessments, the Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality (AHRQ) published a technology assessment on fetal surgery in April 2011.  
 
Fetal Urinary Tract Obstruction  
Systematic Reviews 
The 2011 AHRQ assessment identified 26 publications representing 25 unduplicated reports on fetal 
interventions for obstructive uropathy. From the 3 prospective cohorts and 8 retrospective cohorts 
identified, 24 fetuses had placements of shunts, 11 had other treatments for posterior urethral valves, 14 
had no fetal intervention, and 13 pregnancies were terminated due to poor prognosis. Overall, 53% to 
66% of infants who had shunt placement survived short term. However, more than half of otherwise 
normal infants who have only isolated bladder outlet tract obstruction and do not have multiple 
anomalies or syndromes, do not recover normal renal function in childhood, and the majority require 
dialysis and renal transplantation. In addition, a proportion of affected infants have clusters of syndromic 
features that are not readily diagnosed prenatally, increasing morbidity among survivors. For example, 
in a follow-up of 18 male children who had survived prenatal vesicoamniotic shunting (follow-up range, 
1-14 years), one-third of the children required dialysis or transplantation, and one-half exhibited 
respiratory, growth and development, or musculoskeletal abnormalities. In spite of this, parents and 
physicians reported the children to be neurodevelopmentally normal, with most having acceptable renal 
and bladder function and satisfactory self-reported quality of life. There is a need to better identify 
appropriate surgical candidates and clarify health outcomes in children who do and do not receive fetal 
intervention to inform decision making. At the time of the AHRQ assessment, 1 publication described 
the design of a multicenter randomized trial of percutaneous shunting for lower urinary tract obstruction 
(PLUTO) that will assess whether intrauterine vesicoamniotic shunting improves pre- and perinatal 
health outcomes in comparison with conservative, noninterventional care.  
 
Randomized Controlled Trials 
Since publication of the 2011 AHRQ assessment, Morris et al published the results of the PLUTO trial. 
The study was an unblinded RCT that included 31 women with male singleton pregnancies, complicated

by an isolated lower urinary tract obstruction, recruited fro m centers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, 
and the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria were an ultrasound diagnosis of LUTO (diagnosed on the basis 
of the visualization of an enlarged bladder and dilated proximal urethra, bilateral or unilateral 
hydronephrosis,  and cystic parenchymal renal disease) about whom the treating physician was uncertain 
as to the optimum management. Women pregnant with fetuses with other major structural or 
chromosomal abnormalities were excluded. Women were randomly allocated to either  prenatal 
intervention, consisting of placement of a vesicoamniotic shunt, or control, consisting of usual care. The 
primary outcome measure was survival to 28 days after birth, with secondary outcomes of survival at 1 
and 2 years, and renal function at 28  days, 1 year, and 2 years (measured by serum creatinine, renal 
ultrasound appearance, and evidence of renal impairment based on need for medical treatment, dialysis, 
or transplantation). The original planned sample size for the trial of 75 pregnancies in each study group 
was based on calculations from a meta -analysis reported by the study authors in 2010 and was designed 
to detect a relative risk of survival with vesicoamniotic shunting of 1.55 with 80% power and an alpha 
level of 0.05. The study was termi nated early due to poor enrollment. Concurrent with the RCT, study 
authors enrolled eligible subjects who elected not to participate due to either patient or physician 
preference in an observational registry. There was a high degree of crossover between gr oups: 3 of 16 
women randomized to receive vesicoamniotic shunting did not receive it, and 2 of 15 women 
randomized to the control group received a vesicoamniotic shunt.  
 
Analyses were conducted on both an intention -to-treat and per -protocol basis. For the  study’s primary 
outcome of 28 -day survival, there was no significant difference between the groups: of the 16 
pregnancies randomly assigned to vesicoamniotic shunting, 8 neonates survived to 28 days, compared 
with 4 from the 15 pregnancies assigned to the  control group (relative risk [RR], 1.88; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.71 to 4.96; p=0.27). Analysis based on treatment received showed a stronger association 
between shunting and survival (RR=3.2; 95% CI, 1.06 to 9.62; p=0.03). The authors conducted a 
Bayesian analysis, combining data from their trial with elicited priors from experts, and found an 86% 
probability that vesicoamniotic shunting increased survival at 28 days. Overall, the authors concluded 
that “survival seemed higher in the fetuses receiv ing vesicoamniotic shunting, but the size and direction 
of the effect remained uncertain.” While strengths of this study included its randomized controlled 
design, and tracking of longer (2 -year) outcomes, it was limited by its failure to reach enrollment targets 
and the significant crossover between treatment and control groups. As such, it is difficult to conclude 
that the lack of significant association between shunting and survival was not due to under  powering.

Morris et al reported on secondary outcomes from the PLUTO trial in a complete health technology 
assessment of the PLUTO trial and the associated registry for patients who elected not to participate in 
the randomized trial portion. Secondary objectives of the trial included cost-effectiveness of 
vesicoamniotic shunting compared with conservative management; effect of vesicoamniotic shunting 
on short-term morbidity; survival and development of chronic renal failure at 1 year of age; identifying 
prognostic markers of outcome; determining clinicians’ prior beliefs about the effectiveness of 
vesicoamniotic shunting; and assessing influences on women’s decision making with respect to opting 
for termination of pregnancy, randomization and the acceptability of the intervention. For the secondary 
outcomes of the randomized portion of the trial, there were no statistically significant differences in 
mortality from 28 days to 1 year, although the point estimate for the RR was in the direction of benefit 
(RR=2.19; 95% CI, 0.69 to 6.94). Of those babies who survived to 1 year, 2 had no evidence of renal 
impairment (vesicoamniotic shunt arm), while 4 in the vesicoamniotic shunt arm and 2 in the 
conservative arm required medical management for renal impairment. One baby in the conservative arm 
had end-stage renal failure at 1 year.  
 
Forty-five women were entered into the concurrent registry; of those, 78% had conservative 
management. Women who were in the registry cohort differed from those randomized: registry patients 
who had conservative management were more likely to have a normal (>5th percentile) amniotic fluid 
volume at diagnosis than those who received vesicoamniotic shunting (p=0.07) or randomized (p=0.05). 
Women in the registry arm were more likely to be diagnosed at 24 or more weeks among these women 
than among those in the randomized group (p=0.003). 
 
Section Summary 
For fetal vesicoamniotic shunting as a therapy for bilateral urinary tract obstruction, evidence from 
retrospective and prospective cohort studies summarized in the 2011 AHRQ technology assessment on 
fetal surgery suggests that vesicoamniotic shunting improves survival, at least in the short term. A 
subsequent small RCT found limited benefit from the procedure; however, the study’s limitations make 
it difficult to confidently conclude that vesicoamniotic shunting is associated with no clinical benefit. 
 
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia 
Tracheal Obstruction for Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia 
In 1999, the TEC Assessment concluded that temporary tracheal obstruction met the TEC criteria as a 
treatment of CDH, based in part on a case series. However, in 2003, Harrison et al, the same authors 
who reported on the original case series, reported the results of a randomized trial of fetoscopic tracheal

occlusion compared with standard postnatal care. Enrollment was stopped at 24 women due to the 
unexpectedly high 90-day infant survival rate with standard care, and thus the safety monitoring board 
concluded that further recruitment would not result in a significant difference between the groups. In 
addition, the fetal surgery group had higher rates of prematurity and lower birth weights. The survival 
rate in the standard treatment group was 73%, considerably higher than the estimated survival rate of 
37% based on historical controls. The survival of infants with a lung- to-head ratio (LHR) greater than 
1.0 was 100% in both groups. In contrast, in other publications, survival has been reported to be 
approximately 10% for children with isolated CDH who have left-sided lesions, liver herniation, and an 
LHR of less than 1.0 during mid-gestation. In this subgroup, temporary placement of a detachable 
balloon to occlude the trachea was reported to result in a survival rate of 55% (35 cases), compared with 
8% survival in a group of contemporary controls treated by postnatal therapy. Based on the results of 
the Harrison et al randomized trial, the policy statement was revised to indicate that tracheal occlusion 
is considered investigational. 
 
More recent evidence for tracheal obstruction for CDH includes a 2011 AHRQ technology assessment 
which identified 25 publications with 21 unduplicated populations from 10 U.S. sites, 9 European sites, 
3 multinational sites, and 5 other countries, for a total of 335 cases. The single RCT was by Harrison et 
al (previously described), with follow-up reported by Cortes et al in 2005. Growth failure occurred in 
56% of controls and 86% of infants who had occlusion. No neurodevelopmental differences were 
observed between groups with follow-up at 1 or 2 years of age. This randomized study reinforces the 
importance of a concomitant control group, as the survival for CDH with postnatal repair also improved 
over time. Also noted were results of the Fetal Endoscopic Tracheal Occlusion (FETO) Task Group in 
Europe, which is using a control group of 86 fetuses with left-sided CDH and liver herniation, managed 
expectantly and live born after 30 weeks of gestation. In this control group, the survival rate increased 
from 0% for LHR of 0.4 to 0.7 to approximately 15% survival for LHR of 0.8 to 0.9, 65% for LHR of 
1.0 to 1.5, and 83% survival for LHR of 1.6 or more. This ongoing series currently has an 11% survival 
for LHR less than 1, which can be used as a reference value for Europe, but not for the United States.  
 
Since publication of the AHRQ assessment, several studies have been published that address fetal 
endoscopic tracheal occlusion in CDH. In 2011, Ruano et al published a small nonrandomized controlled 
study to evaluate the feasibility of percutaneous fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion with a 1-mm 
fetoscope. Thirty-five women were enrolled from 2006 to 2008, of whom 17 were intended for fetal 
intervention and 16 underwent successful fetal tracheal occlusion. Nine of 17 (52.9%) of fetal

intervention infants and 1 of 18 (5.6%) of control group infants survived to 28 days, and the authors 
concluded the intervention was feasible. 
 
In a subsequent study reported in 2012, Ruano et al reported a small randomized trial that compared 
percutaneous FETO with postnatal management in 41 patients whose fetuses had severe CDH (LHR 
<1.0 and at least one-third of the fetal liver herniated into the thoracic cavity). All fetuses in the FETO 
group were delivered by ex-utero intrapartum therapy to remove the tracheal balloon; controls were 
delivered by Cesarean section at a maximum gestational age of 38 weeks. The primary outcome, survival 
to 6 months of age by intention- to-treat analysis, was 50% (10/20) in the fetal surgery group and 4.8% 
(1/21) in controls (RR=10.5). Mean delivery was about 2 weeks earlier in the fetal surgery group 
compared with controls (35.6 weeks vs 37.4). There was a trend for a higher frequency of premature 
delivery (<37 weeks, 50% FETO vs 28.6% controls) and extreme premature delivery (<32 weeks, 15% 
FETO and 0% controls) in the FETO group. For the 10 survivors in the FETO group, the mean age at 
hospital discharge was 34.7 days.

In 2014, Rocha et al published a retrospective case -control study to compare left heart structure size in 
patients with CDH who underwent fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion with those managed 
conservatively. Based on observational data that infants born w ith CDH have small left heart structures, 
possibly due to direct compression by herniated abdominal organs and/or abnormal orientation of the 
inferior vena cava and foramen ovale, the authors postulated that increased lung size associated with 
fetal endosc opic tracheal occlusion may lead to increased left heart structure size in patients with CDH. 
The study included 9 cases with left -sided CHD and an LHR of 1 or less who underwent fetal endoscopic 
tracheal occlusion who were compared with 25 similar control s who did not undergo fetal intervention. 
Mortality did not differ significantly between groups (67% in the fetal intervention group vs 52% in the 
control group, p=NS). At birth, the intervention group had larger left ventricular (LV) end -diastolic 
volume (indexed to body surface area) (16.8 vs 12.76 mL/m2, p<0.05), LV length z score ( -2.05 vs -4, 
p<0.01), LV:right ventricular (RV) length ratio (1.43 vs 1.04, p< 0.05), left pulmonary artery diameter 
z score (+1.71 vs -1.04, p<0.05), and better growth of the  aortic valve ( -2.18 vs -3.3, p< 0.01). The 
authors note that fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion may have benefits in postnatal cardiac output and 
pulmonary hypertension but that the potential benefits of fetal treatment for CDH are still currently 
under investigation in several trials and must be weighed against the risks of prematurity and risk to the 
mother.

In 2014, Shan et al published a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating fetal endoscopic 
tracheal occlusion for CDH. The authors included 3 studies identified as RCTs, including Harrison et al 
(2003), Ruano et al (2011), and Ruano et al (2012). In pooled analysis, patients treated with fetal 
endoscopic tracheal occlusion had higher survival rates than patients treated with standard therapy: 
27/48 vs 12/52 (OR for survival with fetal treatment, 5.95; 95% CI, 2.11 to 16.78; p<0.000). Patients 
treated with fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion had an earlier average gestational age at delivery than 
patients treated with standard therapy (mean difference, -3.43 weeks; 95% CI, -6.82 to -0.04; p<0.05). 
However, the pooled estimates are difficult to interpret in that 1 study categorized by the authors as an 
RCT was a controlled but nonrandomized study (Ruano et al [2011]). 
 
Section Summary  
Although early (before 2003) noncomparative studies suggested benefit from fetal endoscopic tracheal 
occlusion for the treatment of CDH, the most direct evidence related to the effectiveness of this 
procedure comes from 2 RCTs from 2003 and 2012 which report conflicting findings. The 2012 RCT 
demonstrated promising findings of improved survival at 6 months post delivery in patients treated with 
fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion. However, given the inconclusive results in the randomized trial by 
Harrison et al, additional study is needed to determine the survival benefit with greater certainty. Longer 
follow-up is also needed to evaluate morbidity (eg, neurologic and pulmonary outcomes) in survivors. 
 
Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation) or 
Bronchopulmonary Sequestration 
The 2011 AHRQ assessment identified 17 publications describing 6 distinct cohorts and 4 case series 
from 7 academic centers in the United States, South America, Europe, and Asia. Of approximately 401 
infants believed to have congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAMs), 54 had 
thoracoamniotic shunting and 3 had open procedures, with the goal of decompressing the lung lesion. 
An additional 13 fetuses with BPS were described. In the cohorts, 44% to 100% of infants who had 
thoracoamniotic shunts survived to birth or through neonatal hospitalization; there was an overall 
survival rate of 54% in the literature. For fetuses with hydrops, survival was 20% to 30% following 
surgical treatment compared with 5.7% for untreated hydrops. Because some infants with large CCAMs 
respond to in utero medical treatment with steroids, failure to respond to steroids may be an entry 
criterion for future surgical interventions.  
 
In 2014, White et al reported outcomes after the use of a transabdominal, transuterine percutaneous 
thoracoabdominal shunt creation technique in 5 fetuses with nonimmune hydrops due to fetal thoracic

abnormalities. The study was a retrospective review of fetal thoracic abnormality cases treated with 
percutaneous shunt creation by a combination of interventional radiology and maternal-fetal medicine 
team at a single institution from 2007 to 2012. Eligible fetuses had to have a thoracic abnormality, no 
infection, an absence of lethal genetic abnormalities, and have a normal karyotype. All fetuses with type 
I congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) received betamethasone to attempt to decrease 
the CPAM size. Seven shunts were placed in 5 patients. There was 1 case of fetal distress requiring 
induction of labor at 31 weeks, 2 days gestation. After delivery, all of the shunts were in place in the 
thoracic cavity. Three of the infants underwent uncomplicated surgical resection of type I CPAMs and 
were discharged home. Two infants with chylothoraces had bilateral chest tubes placed after delivery 
and were discharged home after the chylothoraces resolved. 
 
Sacrococcygeal Teratoma 
At the time of the 1999 TEC Assessment, the published literature included only 4 cases of fetal surgery 
for SCT. However, in utero surgery resulted in prenatal resolution of hydrops, healthy long-term 
survival, and normal development in some children. These results were impressive given the near-
certain fetal mortality when fetal hydrops is left untreated. For example, in a 2004 report of 4 cases of 
open surgical resection of SCT, Hedrick et al reported 1 neonatal death and 3 survivals with a follow-
up range of 20 months to 6 years. Complications other than the fetal death included 1 embolic event, 1 
chronic lung disease, and 1 tumor recurrence. The 2011 AHRQ assessment identified a total of 7 
retrospective cohorts and case series from 3 academic fetal surgery groups in the United States and the 
United Kingdom. The 17 fetuses reported to be treated with open surgery were compared with 94 cases 
with other interventions or no intervention; however, the expectant management cases were less severe. 
Other ablation methods included alcohol sclerosis (all 3 cases died), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (4/7 
survived), and laser ablation (all 4 died). For open surgical procedures, the survival rates were 33% to 
75%. All fetal and neonatal deaths occurred among patients with hydrops or with prodromal 
cardiovascular changes concerning for developing hydrops. Challenges in this area are the early and 
reliable detection of development of hydrops and the timing of the fetal intervention.  
 
In 2014, Van Mieghem et al reported a case series of 5 fetuses with SCT treated with fetal interventions, 
along with a systematic review on fetal therapies for solid SCTs. Cases included in the case series were 
women presenting between 17 5/7 and 26 4/7 weeks of gestation with fetuses found to have large SCT 
with evidence of fetal heart failure. Treatment was conducted with fetoscopic laser ablation (n=1), RFA 
(n=2), or interstitial laser ablation with or without vascular coiling (n=2). Two intrauterine fetal deaths 
occurred; the remaining 3 cases resulted in preterm labor within 10 days of surgery. Of those surviving

to delivery, 1 death occurred and 2 infants survived without procedure-related complications but with 
complications of prematurity. In the authors’ literature review, 21 case repo rts, case series, and cohort 
studies were identified, which were generally assessed to be of poor to fair quality. Twenty-nine cases 
of minimally invasive procedures, with embolization of the SCT vasculature by a variety of therapies, 
for fetal SCT treatment were identified, which were associated with an overall survival rate of 44%. 
Twelve cases of open fetal surgery for SCT were identified, with survival of 55%. The authors note that, 
in the absence of treatment, fetal mortality with large fetal vascular SCTs approaches 100%, providing 
a rationale for fetal intervention. 
 
Myelomeningocele 
Systematic Reviews 
As outlined in the 2011 AHRQ assessment, more than 200 fetuses with myelomeningocele have 
undergone open surgical repair in the United States. All of the 25 reports on open surgery that were 
identified in the AHRQ assessment were based on 4 series of patients from 4 academic medical centers 
in the United States. Two of the studies had concurrent comparisons. One of these analyzed the first 29 
cases of open myelomeningocele repair at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, finding significant 
reductions in the need for postnatal shunt placement (51% vs 91%) and reduced hindbrain herniation 
(38% vs 95%). However, both prospective studies found that in utero repair was associated with greater 
rates of oligohydramnios (48% vs 4%), lower gestational ages (33 vs 37 weeks), and no difference in 
lower extremity function.  
 
Randomized Controlled Trials 
In 2011, results of the National Institutes of Health‒sponsored R CTs, the Management of 
Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) comparing prenatal repair with standard postnatal repair were 
published. The trial began in 2003 and was expected to enroll 200 women ages 18 years or older who 
were pregnant with fetuses with myelomeningocele. Women assigned to have prenatal surgery were 
scheduled for surgery within 1 to 3 days after they were randomized and stayed near the MOMS center 
until they delivered by Cesarean section. Women in the postnatal group traveled back to their assigned 
MOMS center to deliver, also by Cesarean section, around the 37th week of their pregnancies. Follow-
up on the children was scheduled to be performed at 1 year and 2.5 years of age to evaluate motor 
function, developmental progress, and bladder, kidney, and brain development. There was a voluntary 
moratorium in the United States on conducting in utero repair of myelomeningocele outside of this trial.

The inclusion criteria for MOMS included singleton pregnancy, myelomeningocele with the upper 
boundary loca ted between T1 and S1, evidence of hindbrain herniation, gestational age of 19.0 to 25.9 
weeks at randomization, normal karyotype, U.S. residency, and maternal age at least 18 years. Major 
exclusion criteria were fetal anomaly unrelated to myelomeningocele , severe kyphosis, risk of preterm 
birth, placental abruption, body mass index (BMI) of 35 or greater, contradiction to surgery including 
previous hysterotomy in the active uterine segment. Surgeons had performed at least 15 cases before 
this randomized st udy. Primary outcomes were a composite of fetal or neonatal death or the need for a 
cerebrospinal fluid shunt (shunt placement or meeting criteria for shunt) at 12 months and a composite 
score of the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II and the child’s 
motor function at 30 months adjusted by level of lesion. Secondary outcomes were surgical and 
pregnancy complications and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Women were randomized to treatment 
group in 1:1 ratio.  
 
Recruitment for the trial, planned to include 200 subjects, was stopped at 183 subjects when a clear 
advantage of prenatal intervention was apparent. The report includes 158 women randomized before 
July 1, 2009. Outcomes up to 30 months are based on 138 women randomized before December 1, 2007. 
Groups were similar other than that there were more female fetuses and the lesion level was more severe 
in the prenatal surgery group. Two perinatal deaths occurred in each treatment group. Both deaths in the 
prenatal surgery group occurred on the fifth postoperative day, a still birth at 26 weeks and a neonatal 
death due to prematurity at 23 weeks of gestation. Two neonates in the postnatal surgery group died 
with severe symptoms of the Chiari II malformation. Fetal or neonatal death or the need for shunt 
occurred in 68% of infants in the prenatal-surgery group and in 98% of the postnatal-surgery group 
(RR=0.70; 97.7% CI, 0.58 to 0.84; p<0.001). Shunts were placed in 40% of the prenatal surgery and in 
82% of postnatal-surgery groups (p<0.001). At 12 months, 4% of infants in the prenatal surgery group 
had no evidence of hindbrain herniation versus 36% in the postnatal surgery group. There was 1 death 
in each group between 12 and 30 months (coxsackie septicemia in a child who received prenatal surgery 
and complications of chemotherapy for choroid plexus carcinoma in a child who received postnatal 
surgery). The composite of score of Bayley Scales and motor function adjusted by lesion level at 30 
months was significantly better in the prenatal surgery group: mean (SD), 148.6 (57.5) in the prenatal 
surgery group (n=64) versus mean 122.6 (57.2) in the postnatal surgery group (n=70) (p=0.007).  
 
Maternal morbidity and complications related to prenatal surgery included oligohydramnios, 
chorioamniotic separation, placental abruption, and spontaneous membrane rupture. At delivery, an area 
of dehiscence or a very thin prenatal uterine surgery scar was seen at delivery in one-third of mothers

who had prenatal fetal surgery (all subsequent pregnan cies should be delivered by Cesarean section 
before the onset of labor). The average gestational age of babies in the prenatal surgery group was 34.1 
weeks, and 13% were delivered before 30 weeks of gestation. One -fifth of infants in the prenatal surgery 
group had evidence of respiratory distress syndrome, which was likely related to prematurity. The 
authors observed that “in the case of infants with low lumbar and sacral sessions, in whom less 
impairment in lower -limb function may be predicted, the normali zation of hindbrain position and the 
minimization of the need for postnatal placement of cerebral spinal shunt may be the primary indication 
for surgery.” They caution that the potential benefits of fetal surgery must be balanced against the risks 
of prema ture delivery and maternal morbidity and that continued assessment is required to learn if early 
benefits of prenatal surgery are sustained and the effects of fetal surgery on bowel and bladder 
continence, sexual function, and mental capacity. They warn th at results of this trial should not be 
generalized to centers with less experience or to patients who do not meet eligibility criteria.  
 
Uncontrolled Series 
A 2004 report by Bruner et al described minimum 12-month follow-up of 116 fetuses after intrauterine 
repair of spina bifida (myelomeningocele or myeloschisis). Sixty-one fetuses (54%) required 
ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement for hydrocephalus. Statistical analysis revealed that fetuses were 
less likely to require ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement when surgery was performed at 25 weeks or 
earlier, when ventricular size was less than 14 mm at the time of surgery, and when the defects were 
located at L4 or below. Johnson et al reported on the results of a series of 50 fetuses who underwent 
open fetal closure of a myelomeningocele between 20 and 24 weeks of gestation. Fetal selection criteria 
included the presence of hindbrain herniation and sonographic evidence of intact neurologic function, 
ie, movement of the lower extremities and absence of clubfoot deformities. Perinatal survival was 94%, 
with a mean age at delivery of 34 weeks. All fetuses demonstrated reversal of hindbrain herniation; 43% 
required ventriculoperitoneal shunting compared with 68% to 100% in historical controls, depending on 
the location of the myelomeningocele. Another study reporting leg function at longer follow-up showed 
no difference between patients treated with fetal surgery at 20 to 28 weeks versus traditional surgery.  
 
In 3 papers, investigators at the University of Pennsylvania reported outcomes of myelomeningocele 
repair in 54 patients treated before the voluntary moratorium. At median follow-up of 66 months (range, 
36-113 months), 37 of 54 (69%) walk independently, 13 of 54 (24%) are assisted walkers, and 4 of 54 
(7%) are wheelchair dependent. The strongest factors predicting a lower likelihood to walk 
independently were higher level lesion (>L4) and the development of clubfoot deformity after fetal 
intervention. Most independent ambulators, and all children who require assistive devices to walk,

experience significant deficits in lower-extremity coordination. Thirty children returned at 5 years of 
age for neurocognitive examination. In this highly selected group, most children had average preschool 
neurodevelopmental scores, and children who did not require shunt placement were more likely to have 
better scores. A survey of 48 families focused on hindbrain herniation (HH)‒ass ociated brainstem 
dysfunction, eg, apnea, neurogenic dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, neuro-ophthalmologic 
disturbances. Half of the children required shunting. At a median age of 72 months, 15 nonshunted and 
10 shunted children were free of HH symptoms. There were no HH-related deaths, and no children 
developed severe persistent cyanotic apnea. Most children had no or only mild brainstem dysfunction. 
The authors conclude that reversal of HH after fetal surgery may help reduce the incidence and severity 
of brainstem dysfunction.  
 
Investigators at a German center performed a retrospective analysis of expectantly managed patients 
who received surgical intervention within 2 days of birth at their institution and compared them with 
reports of outcomes after fetal surgery from other centers including those previously discussed and to 
data from historical controls. Patients were born between 1979 and 2009 and are now a mean (SD) of 
13.3 (8.9) years old. Gestational age at birth in the expectantly managed group was 37.8 weeks, 
significantly higher than in the prenatal surgery patients. In the expectantly managed group, shunt 
placement was required in 69.8% at mean (SD) age of 16.0 (10.7) days, which is less than for historical 
controls and comparable with data reported on patients who received fetal surgery. The authors suggest 
that inconsistency in clinical criteria for shunting used in studies might contribute to differences in this 
outcome. Among their expectantly managed patients, 56.4% were assisted walkers and 64.1% attended 
regular classes, both comparable with historical controls. Noting the discrepancy in the rate of assisted 
walkers and wheelchair users between expectantly managed patients/historical controls and patients who 
received surgery, the authors observe that the mean age of the study population was 21.7 years for 
historical controls, 13.3 years for their population, and only 67.0 months after fetal surgery. They cite 
earlier papers reporting mobility decreases from early childhood to the early teens including one 
reporting that “the percentage of patients ambulating the majority of time decreased from 76% at 0 -5 
years to 46% at 20- 25 years, with a flattening beyond 10 years.”  
 
Following publication of the MOMS results, Moldenhauer et al published outcomes for a cohort of 
patients treated at single institution with fetal myelomeningocele repair from 2011 to 2014. A total of 
587 patients were referred for potential fetal myelomeningocele repair during the study period, of which 
348 (59.3%) underwent on-site evaluations and 209 (35.6%) were excluded due to noncandidacy for the 
procedure (BMI >35, additional fetal anomalies, genetic diagnosis in the fetus, gestational age >26

weeks, preexisting maternal medical condition, multiple pregnancy, an d no HH on magnetic resonance 
imaging). A total of 139 (23.7%) patients were considered potential candidates for fetal 
myelomeningocele repair, of which 101 underwent open fetal surgery, 13 had postnatal management, 
and 25 underwent pregnancy termination. The average gestational age at the time of fetal surgery was 
23.4 weeks. Fetal resuscitation (need for intraoperative cardiac compressions and/or administration of 
atropine, epinephrine, or blood products via the umbilical vein) was successfully performed in 5 cases. 
Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) occurred in 31 of 96 (32.3%), and preterm labor 
occurred in 36 of 96 (37.5%). Sixteen patients had PPROM with preterm labor. The perinatal loss rate 
was 6.1% (6/98), which included 2 intrauterine d emises, 1 diagnosed at the conclusion of fetal 
myelomeningocele repair and 1 on postoperative day 1, and 4 neonatal deaths. Maternal complications 
included clinical chorioamnionitis (n=4), persistent oligohydramnios (n=6), pre -eclampsia/gestational 
hyperte nsion (n=1), and placental abruption (n=2). For the 83 patients who were live  born at the authors’ 
institution, HH was reversed in 71.1%, and the functional level improved compared with prenatal 
sonographic bony lesion level in 44 of 80 (55%) neonates who were assessed. The authors conclude that 
their experience with fetal myelomeningocele repair was similar to that reported in the MOMS trial.  
 
Bennett et al compared outcomes for a cohort of patients treated with fetal myelomeningocele repair in 
the post- MOMS era with those treated at the same institution during MOMS. Outcomes were evaluated 
for 43 patients treated with fetal myelomeningocele repair from 2011 to 2013 and compared with those 
for 78 patients treated as part of MOMS. During the study time period, the repair technique was modified 
so that no uterine trocar was used, and uterine entry, manipulation, and closure were modified to reduce 
amniotic membrane separation. Although the mean gestational age at delivery was similar for the post-
MOMS and the MOMS cohort (34.4 weeks vs 34.1 weeks, respectively), a greater proportion of post-
MOMS cohort subjects were born after 37 weeks of gestation (39% vs 21%, p=0.03). Post-MOMS 
cohort subjects had lower incidences of premature rupture of membranes (22% vs 46%, p=0.011) and 
chorioamnion separation (0% vs 26%, p<0.001). These results suggest that fetal myelomeningocele 
repair outcomes in practice can be comparable with or better than those obtained in the MOMS study. 
 
Section Summary 
The most direct evidence related to fetal myelomeningocele repair comes from an RCT, the MOMS 
study, which demonstrated significant benefits across multiple outcomes for fetal repair. Single-arm 
studies have supported these findings. Therefore, fetal myelomeningocele may be considered medically 
necessary following informed decision making for cases that meet the criteria of the MOMS study.

Cardiac Malformations 
The 2011 AHRQ technology assessment included the following evidence on fetal surgery for cardiac 
malformations:  
• Two case series (n=10) were identified on fetal surgery for pulmonary atresia and intact 
ventricular septum. The literature was described as scant, reflecting the early formative period 
of development of procedures for this rare condition.  
• Eight prospecti ve case series (n=90) were identified on balloon dilation for critical aortic 
stenosis. One center in the United Kingdom, 2 centers in Germany, 2 in Brazil, and 1 in the 
United States performed this procedure. Seventy patients are from Boston. The 2011 tec hnology 
assessment concluded that it is difficult to determine whether the procedure changes long -term 
outcomes, since it appears to increase the risk of fetal loss but potentially prevents neonatal 
deaths. However, it did appear that technical success imp roves over time within a dedicated team 
and center. For example, the North American center improved their success rate from 25% to 
90% over a period of several years. Overall, the literature was considered to be very early in 
development.  
• Three case serie s from 1 U.S. institution with a cumulative total of 24 patients were identified 
on creation in utero of an atrial septal defect for an intact atrial septum. There were no reports of 
this procedure being performed outside of the United States. The procedur e appears to have 
technical success; however, mortality remains high, and no controlled trials were available to 
compare outcomes in patients treated prenatally with those treated postnatally.  
 
The AHRQ report concluded that overall, procedures for severe fetal cardiac anomalies are in an early 
stage. Preliminary work is being reported in a few highly specialized centers that are establishing the 
groundwork for feasibility and future directions for outcomes research in this area. The authors 
concluded that the most pressing challenge in this area is the ability to identify the “right” patient whose 
care would be compromised by waiting to do a postnatal repair.  
 
McElhinney et al analyzed their experience with 70 prenatal balloon aortic valvuloplasties attempted in 
mid-gestational fetuses between March 2000 and October 2008 for critical aortic stenosis with evolving 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) to identify factors associated with procedural and postnatal 
outcomes. Median gestational age was 23.2 weeks (range, 20-31 weeks). Technical success was 
achieved in 52 fetuses. Compared with 21 untreated comparison fetuses, subsequent prenatal growth of 
the aortic and mitral valves, but not the left ventricle, was improved after intervention. Nine pregnancies 
did not reach viable term or preterm birth. Seventeen patients had a biventricular circulation postnatally,

15 of them from birth. Two of these patients had no neonatal intervention. Sixteen were alive at a median 
age of 2.1 years (range, 4 months to 7 years). The other patient died of unrelated causes. Guidelines for 
assessing the potential for a biventricular circulation changed over the period of the study and became 
more selective. Larger left heart structures and higher LV pressure at the time of intervention were 
associated with biventricular outcome. The authors conclude that further investigation is required before 
it is possible to predict whether fetal intervention will result in improved left heart growth and postnatal 
survival with a biventricular circulation, and “the potential befits of fetal intervention must be weighed 
against the risk of technical failure, fetal demise, aortic regurgitation, and potential long-term adverse 
events that have yet to be identified.”  
 
In 2013, Marantz et al reported results from a case series of 5 prenatal balloon aortic valvuloplasties for 
fetuses with aortic stenosis and risk of progression to HLHS. The procedure was technically successful 
in all cases with no maternal complications or fetal demise. One pregnancy was terminated after the 
procedure; of the remaining cases, 1 progressed to hypoplastic left heart syndrome and 3 did not. Rates 
of longer term survival and complications are not provided. The authors conclude that fetal aortic 
valvuloplasty is safe and feasible.  
 
Pedra et al reported a case series of 22 fetal cardiac interventions for several cardiac conditions in 21 
fetuses in Brazil. Fetal cardiac intervention was considered for the following echocardiographic findings 
in patients with isolated cardiac defects (ie, no other structural abnormality or marker for chromosomal 
abnormality): (1) critical aortic stenosis with evolving HLHS (n=9); (2) critical aortic stenosis, massive 
mitral regurgitation, giant left atrium, and hydrops (n=4); (3) HLHS with intact interatrial septum or 
small patent foramen ovale (n=4); (4) pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum or critical 
pulmonary stenosis with impending hypoplastic right heart syndrome (HRHS) (n=4). Fetal interventions 
included atrial septostomy, aortic valvuloplasty, pulmonary valvuloplasty, or a combination of aortic 
septostomy and aortic valvuloplasty in 1 case. Technical success was achieved in 20 of 22 procedures 
(91%), with 1 failed aortic and 1 failed pulmonary valvuloplasty. There was 1 fetal death, and no 
maternal complications. Longer term outcomes were generally poor, even among those with successful 
interventions. Among the 20 with successful fetal interventions, 8 eventually achieved biventricular 
circulation, with 1 “probable” biventricu lar circulation, and 12 deaths occurred. 
 
Chaturvedi et al reported outcomes from a series of 10 fetuses who underwent active perinatal 
management for HLHS with restrictive or intact atrial septum at a single institution from 2000 to 2012. 
Four of the identified fetuses underwent percutaneous stenting of the atrial septum. No maternal

complications occurred. At follow-up, 2 children were alive at 16 and 20 months. Two neonatal deaths 
occurred in fetuses with the highest left atrial hypertension before intervention and recurrence in utero 
of left atrial hypertension secondary to stent stenosis. 
 
Kalish et al reported outcomes for 9 fetuses with HLHS with intact atrial septum who underwent prenatal 
atrial septal stent placement. Atrial septal stent placement was attempted in 9 fetuses, with successful 
stent deployment in 5, of which 4 demonstrated flow across the stent at the time of intervention. In the 
remaining 4 cases, stent placement was technically unsuccessful, but in 75% of cases, atrial balloon 
septoplasty during the same procedure was successful. One fetal death occurred, along with 4 neonatal 
deaths, 2 of which had undergone stenting. No maternal complications were reported.  
 
Section Summary 
Evidence related to fetal interventions for congenital heart defects ⎯particularly for evolving HLHS and 
critical pulmonary stenosis/pulmonary atresia ⎯is limited to small case series. Although postnatal 
repair/correction of these severe cardiac defects is associated with very high morbidity and mortality, 
further studies are needed to demonstrate that health outcomes are improved with fetal interventions. 
Randomized trials are unlikely to be conducted, but comparative studies with concurrent controls would 
provide further insight into the net benefit of and appropriate patient populations for fetal cardiac 
interventions. 
 
Other 
The use of fetal surgery for other defects is expanding; recent case reports include prenatal correction 
of cleft lip and palate and decompression of the fetal trachea.  
 
A review of 187 maternal-fetal surgeries performed at the University of California San Francisco Fetal 
Treatment Center found significant short-term maternal morbidity but no maternal deaths. Postsurgical 
complications included increased rates of Cesarean birth, treatment in intensive care, prolonged 
hospitalization, and blood transfusion. 
 
No new studies of fetal surgery for other applications were identified in the 2011 literature update.  
 
Ongoing and Unpublished Clinical Trials 
A search of Clinical Trials.gov on October 27, 2013, identified several ongoing trials of various fetal 
surgeries. Most of the surgical procedures are in the early stages of evaluation.

Summary of Evidence 
Due to a number of factors, including the rarity of the conditions and the small number of centers 
specializing in fetal interventions, the evidence on fetal surgery is limited. Fetal surgery for many 
congenital conditions, including CDH and heart defects, has not been shown to improve health outcomes

in comparison with postnatal treatment. The available evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that fetal 
tracheal occlusion for CDH and fetal intervention for evolving HLHS and critical pulmonary stenosis 
or pulmonary atresia provides improved health outcomes. For these and other applications of fetal 
surgery that are currently considered investigational, additional studies are needed to identify 
appropriate candidates and to evaluate longer term outcomes compared with postnatal management.  
 
For conditions leading to fetal hydrops (certain cases of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, 
bronchopulmonary sequestration, sacrococcygeal teratoma), for which mortality approaches 100%, fetal 
surgery may be considered medically necessary. For bilateral urinary tract obstruction, evidence from 
retrospective and prospective cohort studies summarized in the 2011 Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality technology assessment on fetal surgery suggests that vesicoamniotic shunting improves 
survival, at least in the short term. A recent small, randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of 
vesicoamniotic shunting found limited benefit from the procedure when data were analyzed by 
intention- to-treat analysis. However, the study’s significant limitations, includ ing low enrollment 
leading to early cessation of the study and significant crossover between treatment and control groups, 
make it difficult to generalize its finding of no significant benefit from treatment. As such, 
vesicoamniotic shunting for bilateral urinary tract obstruction may also be considered medically 
necessary to minimize the effects of this condition on kidney and lung development. Additional studies 
for these surgeries are needed to better define the appropriate surgical candidates, the most effective 
timing of the interventions, and the long-term health outcomes in surviving children.  
 
Data from the MOMS trial show that prenatal repair of myelomeningocele reduces the need for shunting 
in the first 12 months after delivery and improves a composite measure of mental and motor function, 
with adjustment for lesion level, at 30 months of age. Prenatal surgery also improves the degree of 
hindbrain herniation and the likelihood of being able to walk independently when compared with 
postnatal surgery. The long-term impact on function needs to be evaluated, and benefits must be 
balanced against risks to mother and child. Thus, fetal surgery may be considered medically necessary 
following informed decision making for cases of prenatal myelomeningocele that meet the criteria of 
the MOMS study.

*Investigational – A medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product is 
Investigational if the effectiveness has not been clearly tested and it has not been incorporated into 
standard medical practice. Any determination we make that a medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is Investigational will be based on a consideration of the following: 
A. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product can be 
lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
whether such approval has been granted at the time the medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is sought to be furnished; or 
B. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product requires 
further studies or clinical trials to determine its maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, safety, 
effectiveness, or effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or 
diagnosis, must improve health outcomes, according to the consensus of opinion among 
experts as shown by reliable evidence, including: 
1. Consultation with technology evaluation center(s); 
2. Credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community; or 
3. Reference to federal regulations. 
 
**Medically Necessary (or “Medical Necessity”) - Health care services, treatment, procedures, 
equipment, drugs, devices, items or supplies that a Provider, exercising prudent clinical judgment,

injury, disease or its symptoms, and that are: 
A. In accordance with nationally accepted standards of medical practice;
