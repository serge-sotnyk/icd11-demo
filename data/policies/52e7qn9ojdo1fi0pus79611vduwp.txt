Coverage for services, procedures, medical devices  and drugs are dependent upon benefit 
eligibility as outlined in the member's specific benefit plan.  This Evidence -Based Criteria  must be 
read in its entirety to determine coverage eligibility, if any . 
 
This Evidence -Based Criteria  provides information related to coverage determinations only and 
does not imply that a service or treatment is clinically appropriate or inappropriate. The provider 
and the member are responsible for all decisions regarding the appropriateness of care. Pr oviders 
should provide BCBSAZ complete medical rationale when requesting any exceptions to these 
guidelines.  
 
The section identified as “ Description ” defines or describes a service, procedure, medical device 
or drug and is in no way intended as a statement  of medical necessity and/or coverage . 
 
The section identified  as “Criteria ” defines criteria to determine wh ether a service, procedure, 
medical device or drug is considered medically necessary or experimental or investigational . 
 
State or federal mandates, e.g., FEP program, may dictate that any drug, device or biological 
product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may not be considered 
experimental or investigational and thus the drug, device or biological prod uct may be assessed 
only on the basis of medical necessity.  
 
Evidence -Based Criteria  are subject to change as new information becomes available.  
 
For purposes of this Evidence -Based Criteria , the terms "experimental" and "investigational" are 
considered to be interchangeable.

Criteria : 
 
➢ Aduhelm  (aducanumab -avwa)  and Leqembi  (lecanemab -irmb)  are considered experimental or 
investigational  and will not be covered when any ONE  or more of the following criteria are met:  
 
1. Lack of final approval from the appropriate governmental regulatory bodies (e.g., Food and Drug 
Administration); or  
2. Insufficient scientific evidence to permit conclusions concerning the effect on health outcomes; or  
3. Insufficient evidence to support improvement of the net health outcome; or  
4. Insufficient evidence to support improvement of the net health outcome as much as , or more 
than, established alternatives; or  
5. Insufficient evidence to support improvement outside the investigational setting.  
 
 
Description : 
 
Aduhelm (aducanumab -avwa ) is a recombinant human immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1)  and Leqembi 
(lecanemab -irmb) is a  humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody . These antibodies are  directed against 
aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid beta.  Aduhelm and Leqembi  are indicated for the 
treatment of Alzheimer’s disease  and should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild 
dementia stage of disease. There  is no safety or effectiveness data on initiating treatment at earlier or 
later stages of AD.   Both are approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in amyloid beta 
plaques in clin ical trials. Continued FDA approval may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit 
in confirmatory trials.
