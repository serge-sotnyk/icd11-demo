Background/Overview  
Multiple Myeloma  
Multiple myeloma is a genetically complex -and invariably fatal -neoplasm of plasma cells.  
 
Disease Description  
Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by clonal proliferation of 
plasma cells derived from B cells in the bone marrow.  It accounts for about 1 in every 100 cancers 
and 13% of hematologic cancers. The American Cancer Society has estimated  34,470 new cases of 
multiple myeloma will occur in the U.S. in  2022,  and some  12,64 0 deaths will occur due to the 
disease.  The annual age -adjusted incidence is about 6 cases per 100,000 persons, with a median age -
at-diagnosis of about 70 years. Before the advent of current treatment protocols, most patients with 
multiple myeloma succumbe d to their disease within 5 to 10 years; in the prechemotherapy era, 
median survival was less than 1 year. Among patients who present at an age younger than 60 years, 
10-year overall survival with current treatment protocols may now exceed 30%. Black indiv iduals 
have double the risk of multiple myeloma compared with White individuals and tend to be diagnosed 
with multiple myeloma at a younger age. 5, Furthermore, Hispanic individuals have a slightly higher  • Deletion 13 on conventional 
cytogenetics

incidence rate than White individuals (6.7 per 100,000 vs. 6.2 per 100,100). R ecent US Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results Program data estimates that the 5 -year age -adjusted mortality rate 
of Black individuals due to multiple myeloma is 6.2 per 100,000, compared with 3.1 per 100,000 
White individuals. However, the 5 -year re lative survival appears to comparable at 53.9% and 51.3% 
for Black and White individuals in the US, respectively. When treatment is standardized, there is 
some evidence that Black individuals have superior survival after multiple myeloma diagnosis 
compared  to White individuals, suggesting that Black individuals have a more indolent disease 
subtype. However, significant disparities in treatment use, access, and referral patterns persist that 
may impair clinical outcomes.  
 
Criteria for the diagnosis, staging,  and response assessment of multiple myeloma developed by the 
International  Myeloma Working Group are in widespread use.  The decision to treat is based on 
criteria set forth in the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, which includes calcium elevation; renal 
insufficiency; anemia; and bone disease (CRAB). Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of 
undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering myeloma do not require therapy, irrespective of 
any associated risk factors -except on specifically targeted protocols.  
 
Pathogenesis and Genetic Architecture of Multiple Myeloma  
Multiple myeloma is a complex disease that presents itself in distinct clinical phases and risk levels. 
They include MGUS and smoldering multiple myeloma (also known as asymptomatic myeloma).  
Monoclon al gammopathy of undetermined significance is a generally benign condition, with a 
transformation rate to symptomatic plasma cell disorders of about 1% to 2% annually.  Smoldering 
multiple myeloma represents a progression from MGUS to frank multiple myeloma ; the risk of the 
disease transforming to multiple myeloma is about 10% for the first 5 years.  Although both of these 
conditions lack many clinical features of multiple myeloma, they may ultimately share 
characteristics that necessitate therapy. By contras t, symptomatic multiple myeloma is defined by 
specific clinical symptoms, accumulation of monoclonal immunoglobulin proteins in the blood or 
urine, and associated organ dysfunction (including nephropathy and neuropathy). The acronym 
CRAB reflects the hallm ark features of multiple myeloma. Premyeloma plasma cells initially require 
interaction with the bone marrow microenvironment; however, during disease progression, the cells 
develop the ability to proliferate outside the bone marrow, manifesting as extrame dullary myeloma 
and plasma cell leukemia. These “bone marrow independent” cells represent the end stages in a 
multistep transformation process from normal to multiple myeloma.

As outlined below, complex genetic abnormalities, commonly identified in multipl e myeloma 
plasma cells, are considered to play major roles in disease initiation, progression, and pathogenesis. 
Further, these abnormalities are used in conjunction with laboratory and radiographic studies to 
stratify patients for therapeutic decisions.  
 
Diagnosis  
Cytogenetic and other laboratory tests identify markers to classify newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma patients into high, intermediate, and standard clinical risk categories. The level of risk 
reflects the aggressiveness of the disease, and ultim ately dictates the intensity of initial treatment. 
Thus, a risk -adapted approach provides optimal therapy to patients, ensuring intense treatment for 
those with the aggressive disease. Further, this approach minimizes toxic effects, thereby delivering 
sufficient -but less -intense -therapy for those with a lower risk of disease. However, it should be noted 
that clinical outcomes can vary substantially, using even the most standard of methods, among 
patients with the same estimated risk who undergo a similar in tensity of treatment.  
 
Microarray -based gene expression profile (GEP) analysis can be used to estimate the underlying 
activity of cellular biological pathways, and these pathways control a host of mechanisms such as 
cell division, cell proliferation, apopt osis, metabolism, and other signaling pathways. Relative over - 
or underexpression of these pathways is considered to mirror disease aggressiveness, independent 
of cytogenetics and other laboratory measures. Gene expression profile analysis has been propose d 
as a means to more finely stratify multiple myeloma patients into risk categories for 2 purposes: (1) 
to personalize therapy selection according to tumor biology  and (2) to avoid over - or undertreating 
patients. Moreover, GEP analysis could be used as a supplement to existing stratification methods, 
or as a stand -alone test; however, further study is needed to confirm that the analysis has the 
capability to perform those roles.  
 
The term  gene expression  refers to the process by which the coded information  of genes (DNA) is 
transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and translated into proteins. A GEP assay simultaneously 
examines the patterns of multiple genes in a single tissue sample; it does this to identify those that 
are actively producing mRNA or not, ult imately producing proteins or not. By concurrently 
measuring the cellular levels of mRNA of thousands of genes, a GEP test creates a picture of the 
rate at which those genes are expressed in a tissue sample.

Gene expression profile tests are not “genetic”  tests. Genetic tests measure an individual DNA 
signature to identify genetic changes or variants that remain constant in the genome. Gene expression 
tests measure the activity of mRNA in a tissue or bodily fluid at a single point, reflecting an 
individual ’s current disease state (or the likelihood of developing a disease). However, because 
mRNA levels are dynamic and change as a result of disease processes or environmental signals, 
dynamic changes in these processes can be studied over time. This informati on thus reflects the 
pathogenic process, and in theory, can be used to assess the effects of therapeutic interventions or 
select therapy based on specifically expressed gene targets.  
 
Gene Expression Analysis of Cancer Using Microarray Technology  
Gene expr ession profile analysis using microarray technology is based on the Watson -Crick pairing 
of complementary nucleic acid molecules.  A collection of DNA sequences, referred to as “probes,” 
are “arrayed” on miniaturized solid support (the “microarray”). They a re used to determine the 
concentration of the corresponding complementary mRNA sequences, called “targets,” isolated from 
a tissue sample. Laboratory advancements in attaching nucleic acid sequences to solid supports, 
combined with robotic technology, have  allowed investigators to miniaturize the scale of the 
reactions. As a result of these advances, it is possible to assess the expression of thousands of 
different genes in a single reaction.  
 
A basic microarray GEP analysis uses mRNA targets that have been  both harvested from a patient’s 
tissue sample and labeled with a fluorescent dye.  These samples are hybridized to the DNA probe 
sequences attached to the microarray medium, then incubated in the presence of mRNA from a 
different sample labeled with a diff erent fluorescent dye. In a 2 color experimental design, samples 
can be directly compared with one another or with a common reference mRNA, and their relative 
expression levels can be quantified. After hybridization, grayscale images corresponding to 
fluor escent signals are obtained by scanning the microarray with dedicated instruments; the 
fluorescence intensity corresponding to each gene is then quantified by specific software. After 
normalization, the intensity of the hybridization signals can be compare d to detect differential 
expression by using sophisticated computational and statistical techniques.  
 
Technical variability is a major concern with microarray technologies for clinical management ; eg, 
the source of mRNA is a technical variable that can affect test results. A ty pical biopsy sample from 
a solid tumor contains a mixture of malignant and normal (stromal) cells that, in turn, will yield total 
RNA that reflects all the cells contained in the specimen. To address this, tissue samples may be

macro - or microdissected (pr ior to RNA extraction) to ensure that the specimens contain a 
sufficiently representative percentage of cancer cells to reflect the disease. For analysis of 
hematologic cancers, including multiple myeloma, immunomagnetic cell separation technology is 
used to isolate and enrich cancerous cells from bone marrow aspirates that contain a mixture of cell 
types.  
 
The instability of mRNA relative to DNA complicates GEP analysis studies, especially when 
comparing the method with genomic analyses. Two factors that affect RNA quality include 
preanalysis storage time and the reagents used to prepare mRNA. Moreover, pH c hanges in the 
storage media can trigger mRNA degradation, as can ribonucleases present in cells, which can 
remain active in the RNA preparation if not stringently controlled.  
 
As noted, Watson -Crick hybridization of complementary nucleic acid moieties in the sequences of 
mRNA and DNA is the basis of any microarray -based GEP test. This means that sequence selection 
and gene annotation are among the most important factors that can  contribute to analytic variability, 
hence validity, in results. Different technologic platforms, protocols, and reagents can affect the 
analytic variability of the results, and therefore affect reproducibility within and across laboratories. 
Gene expressi on measures are virtually never used as raw output but undergo sequential steps of 
mathematical transformation; thus, data preprocessing and analysis may increase variability in 
results. Moreover, different levels of gene expression can be further processe d and combined, 
according to complex algorithms, to obtain composite summary measurements that are associated 
with the phenotype(s) under investigation. A statistical analytic technique known as “unsupervised 
clustering analysis” is applied to the data to produce a visual display, known as a “dendrogram,” that 
shows a hierarchy of similar genes, differentially expressed as mRNA.  
 
International standards have been developed to address the quality of microarray -based GEP 
analysis. These standards focus on do cumentation of experimental design, details, and results. 
Additional topics of interest include interplatform and interlaboratory reproducibility. Quality 
control efforts emphasize the importance of minimizing the sources of variability in gene expression 
analysis, thus ensuring that the information derived from such analyses is specific and does not 
represent accidental associations.

Prognosis and Risk Stratification  
Two validated clinical systems are in widespread use to assess prognosis in newly diagn osed 
multiple myeloma patients: the Durie -Salmon Staging System and the International Staging System.  
The Durie -Salmon Staging System provides a method to measure multiple myeloma tumor burden, 
based on multiple myeloma cell numbers and clinical, laborator y and imaging studies; however, the 
system has significant shortcomings due to its use of observer -dependent studies (eg, radiographic 
evaluation of bone lesions), primarily focused on tumor mass -not behavior. The International 
Staging System, incorporatin g serum albumin and β 2-microglobulin measures, is considered 
valuable because it permits comparison of outcomes across clinical trials; and it is even more 
reproducible than the Durie -Salmon Staging System. However, the International Staging System is 
useful only if a diagnosis of multiple myeloma has already been made; it has no role in MGUS, 
smoldering multiple myeloma, or related plasma cell dyscrasias. Further, the International Staging 
System does not provide a good estimate of tumor burden, nor is it generally useful for therapeutic 
risk stratification. In fact, it may not retain prognostic significance in the era of novel drug therapies.  
 
Although multiple myeloma cells may appear morphologically similar across risk levels, the disease 
exhibits subst antial genetic heterogeneity that may change with progression or at relapse.  
Investigators have used conventional cytogenetic methods (karyotyping) and fluorescence in situ 
hybridization to prognostically stratify multiple myeloma patients according to a h ost of recurrent 
chromosomal changes (immunoglobulin heavy chain translocations, chromosome deletions, or 
amplification). This stratification forms the basis of the Mayo Stratification of Myeloma and Risk -
Adapted Therapy, an evidence -based algorithm to fac ilitate treatment decisions for patients with 
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (Table 1).

In addition to the cytogenetic characteristics noted in Table 1, other findings are typically considered 
in this model. Although GEP analysis is included in Table 1, the Mayo Clinic does not currently 
recommend or routinely perform GEP analysis in a nonres earch setting.  
 
The risk stratification model outlined in Table 1 is meant to prognosticate and to determine the 
treatment approach; it is not used to decide whether to initiate therapy (see Therapy Synopsis 
subsection). Furthermore, therapeutic outcomes among individuals in these categories may vary 
significantly, to the extent that additional means of subdividing patients into response groups are 
under investigation. In particular, molecular profiling using microarray -based methods (see 
Rationale section ). 
 
Therapy Synopsis  
Asymptomatic (smoldering) multiple myeloma and MGUS currently require only ongoing clinical 
observation (this is because early treatment with conventional chemotherapy has shown no benefit). 
However, for symptomatic patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma, prompt induction therapy is 
indicated. For patients younger than age 65 years who have adequate heart, liver, and lung function, 
induction therapy is comprised of combinations that may include melphalan, dexamethasone, 
cyclophosphamide, or doxorubicin with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or bortezomib. Next, the therapy 
includes autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation.  Older patients (or those with underlying 
liver, lung, or cardiovascular dysfunction) may be candidates for  induction followed by reduced -
intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.  
 
A program referred to as Total Therapy, developed primarily at the University of Arkansas for 
Medical Science and at the Mayo Clinic, uses all available agents as induction, followed by 2 cycles

Gene Expression Profile Test  
The MyPRS/MyPRS  Plus GEP70 test analyzes the human genome to determine the level of 
aggressiveness of diagno sed multiple myeloma based on 70 of the most relevant genes involved in 
cellular signaling and proliferation.  
 
FDA or Other Governmental Regulatory Approval  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
Clinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in -house and market them as a laboratory 
service; laboratory -developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The MyPRS™‡/MyPRS  Plus™‡ GEP70  test was 
acquired by Quest Diagnostics in December 2016. Laboratories that offer laboratory -developed tests 
must be licensed by the CLIA for high -complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration has chosen not to require any regulatory r eview of this test.  
 
Rationale/Source  
This medical policy was developed through consideration of peer -reviewed medical literature 
generally recognized by the relevant medical community, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval status, nationally accepted standards of medical practice and accepted standards of medical 
practice in this community, technology evaluation centers, reference to federal regulations, other 
plan medical policies, and accredited national guidelines.  
 
Multiple myel oma is a genetically complex -and invariably fatal -disease. A host of well -
characterized factors related to tumor biology, tumor burden, and patient -centered characteristics are 
used to stratify patients into high -, intermediate -, and standard -risk categori es for prognostic 
purposes, as well as determining treatment intensity. However, clinical outcomes have varied among 
patients in the same risk category who received similar therapy. Thus, more specific methods have 
been sought to classify multiple myeloma;  one such method being proposed is the utilization of a 
microarray -based gene expression profile (GEP) analysis, which serves to reveal the underlying

activity of cellular biologic pathways. This method lends itself to a variety of benefits including the 
ability to risk -stratify patients with multiple myeloma, as well as guide treatment decisions.  
 
Summary of Evidence  
For individuals who have multiple myeloma who received risk stratification using a GEP test, the 
evidence includes retrospective series that correlate risk scores with survival. Relevant outcomes are 
progression -free survival, overall survival, disease -specific survival, test validity, and other test 
performance measures. The microarray -based GEP70 test (MyPRS/MyPRS  Plus) has been reported 
to risk -stratify multiple myeloma patients. Some predictive models in the body of evidence combine 
risk status as determined by the GEP70 test with additional clinical or genetic variables. Patients 
with a high GEP70 risk score have a substantiall y increased risk of mortality compared with patients 
without a high score. However, there is no evidence (from available studies) that this test would add 
incremental value to existing risk stratification methods; nor have any studies demonstrated the need  
to prospectively allocate patients to risk -based therapies based on the GEP70 score. The evidence is 
insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.

*Investigational – A medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product is 
Investigational if the effectiveness has not been clearly tested and it has not been incorporated into 
standard medical practice. Any determination we make that a medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is Investigational will be based on a consideration of the following: 
A. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product can be 
lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
whether such approval has been granted at the time the medical treatment, procedure, drug, 
device, or biological product is sought to be furnished; or 
B. Whether the medical treatment, procedure, drug, device, or biological product requires 
further studies or clinical trials to determine its maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, safety, 
effectiveness, or effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or 
diagnosis, must improve health outcomes, according to the consensus of opinion among 
experts as shown by reliable evidence, including: 
1. Consultation with technology evaluation center(s); 
2. Credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally 
recognized by the relevant medical community; or 
3. Reference to federal regulations.
