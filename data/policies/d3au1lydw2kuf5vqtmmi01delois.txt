Aetna considers all other indications as experimental and 
investigational (for additional information, see Experimental and 
Investigational and Background sections). 
II.  Continuation  of  Therapy  
Aetna considers the continuation of  burosumab -twza (Crysvita)  
therapy medically necessary in members requesting  
reauthorization for an indication listed in Section I who are  
currently  receiving  the  requested  medication  through  a  previously  
authorized  pharmacy  or  medical  beneﬁt   and  who  are  experiencing  
beneﬁt  from  therapy  as  evidenced   by  disease  improvement  or  
disease stability (e.g., increase or normalization in serum  
phosphate, improvement in bone and joint  pain, reduction in  
fractures, improvement in skeletal  deformities).  
Dosage and Admin istration 
Burosumab- twza (Crysvita) is available for injection as 10 mg/mL, 20 
mg/mL, or 30 mg/mL in a single- dose vial. Crysvita is administered by 
subcutaneous (SC) injection and should be administered by a healthcare 
provider. The maximum volume of Crysvita per injection is 1.5 mL. If 
multiple injections are required, administer at different injection sites.

Experimental and Investigational 
Aetna considers burosumab- twza (Crysvita) as experimental and 
investigational for the following indications (not an all -inclusive list) 
because the safety and effectiveness for these indications has not been 
established: 
ﬁbrous dysplasia 
tyrosinem
ia type 1 
Background 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -Approved Indications  
Crysvita (burosumab- twza) is indicated for the treatment of: 
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) in adult and pediatric patients 6 
months of age and older. 
FGF23 -related hypo
phosphatemia intumor induced osteomalacia 
(TIO) associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors that

cannot be curatively resected or localized in adult and  pediatric  
patients 2 years of age and older.  
Burosumab- twza for injection is available as Crysvita (Kyowa Kirin, Inc.;  
Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.). Crysvita is a fibroblast growth factor 23  
(FGF23) blocking antibody.  
Crysvita is contraindicated with oral phosphate and/or active vitamin D  
analogs, when serum phosphorus is within or above the normal range for  
age, and in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal  
disease.  
Labeled warnings and precautions include hypersensitivity,  
hyperphosphatemia and risk of nephrocalcinosis, and injection site  reactions. The most common adverse reactions (25% or more in the  Crysvita group and greater than Active Control) in pediatric XLH  patients included pyrexia, injection sit e reaction, cough, vomiting, pain in  
extremity, headache, tooth abscess, and dental caries. The most common  
adverse reactions (greater than 5% and in at least 2 patients more than  placebo) in adult XLH patients included back pain, headache, tooth  infection , restless legs syndrome, vitamin D decreased, dizziness,  
constipation, muscle spasms, and blood phosphorus increased. The most  
common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) in TIO patients included  
tooth abscess, muscle spasms, dizziness, constipation, inje ction site  
reaction, rash, and headache.  
X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) 
Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is characterized by  
hypophosphatemia and rickets (and/or osteomalacia) that resembles  
vitamin D deficiency but does not respond to vitamin D replacement or  
pharmacologic doses of vitamin D because the underlying cause is renal  
phosphate wasting rather than true vitamin D resistance. X -linked  
hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common heritable form of rickets  
and osteomalacia, with a prevalence of approximately one case per

20,000 live births. XLH causes low levels of phosphorus in the blood. X-
linked hypophosphatemia is caused by excess fibroblast growth factor 23 
(FGF23) which suppresses renal tubular phosphate reabsorption and the 
renal production of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D. Most children with XLH 
experience bowed or bent legs, short stature, bone pain and severe 
dental pain. Some adults with XLH experience persistent discomfort or 
complications, such as joint pain, impaired mobility, tooth abscesses and 
hearing loss. 
Burosumab- twza binds to and inhibits the biological activity of FGF23 
restoring renal phosphate reabsorption and increasing the serum concentration of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D. On April 17, 2018, the FDA 
approved burosumab-twza (Crysvita) with a Breakthrough Therapy designation, under which the FDA provides intensive guidance to the 
company on efficient drug development, and expedites its review of 
drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions where clinical 
evidence shows the drug may represent a substantial improvement 
over other available therapies. Burosumab- twza also received Orphan 
Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage 
the development of drugs for rare diseases. 
The safety  and eff
 icacy  of  burosumab-twza were studied in four  clinical  
trials,  two  in  pediatric  patients  (Study  1 and  Study  2)  and two  in  adult  
patients  (Study  3  and Study  4).  Radiographs  from  52  burosumab- twza - 
treated XLH  patients in  Study  1  and 13 patients  in Study  2  were  
examined to as  sess XLH -related  rickets  using  the 10- point  Thacher  
Rickets Severity Score (  RSS)  and the 7- point  Radiographic  Global  
Impression of  Change (RGI -C).  The RSS score  is  assigned based on  
images  of  the  wrist  and  knee  from  a  single  time-point,  with  higher  scores  
indicating  greater  rickets  severity.  The  RGI-C  score  is  assigned  based  on 
side-by-side c omparisons  of wrist  and knee radiographs from two time-  
points,  with  higher  scores  indicating  greater  improvement  in  radiographic  
evidence  of  rickets.  A RGI -C  score  of  +2.0  was  defined  as  radiographic  
evidence  of  substantial  healing.

Study 1 (NCT 02163577) was a randomized, phase 2, open-label study in 
52 prepubescent XLH patients, 5 to 12 years old, which compared 
treatment with burosumab- twza administered every 2 weeks versus every 
4 weeks. Following an initial 16- week dose titration phase, patients 
completed 48- weeks of treatment with burosumab- twza every 2 weeks. 
All 52 patients completed at least 64 weeks on study; no patient discontinued. Burosumab- twza dose was adjusted to target a fasting 
serum phosphorus concentration of 3.5 to 5.0 mg/dL based on the fasting 
phosphorus level the day of dosing. Twenty -six of 52 patients received 
burosumab- twza every two weeks up to a maximum dose of 2 mg/kg. The 
average dose was 0.73 mg/kg (range: 0.3, 1.5) at week 16, 0.98 mg/kg 
(range: 0.4, 2.0) at week 40 and 1.04 mg/kg (range: 0.4, 2.0) at week 60. 
The remaining 26 patients received burosumab- twza every four weeks. At 
study entry, the mean age of patients was 8.5 years and 46% were male. 
Ninety -six percent had received oral phosphate and active vitamin D 
analogs for a mean (SD) duration of 7 (2.4) years. Oral phosphate and 
active vitamin D analogs were discontinued prior to study enrollment. 
Ninety -four percent of patients had radiographic evidence of rickets at 
baseline. Burosumab- twza increased mean (SD) serum phosphorus 
levels from 2.4 (0.40) at baseline to 3.3 (0.40) and 3.4 (0.45) mg/dL at 
week 40 and week 64 in the patients who received burosumab- twza 
every  2 weeks.  The ratio of  renal  tubular  maximum  reabsorption  rate  of  
phosphate to glomerular filtration r  ate ( TmP/GFR) increased in these 
patients  from  mean (SD)  of  2.2 (0.49)  at  baseline  to  3.3 (0.60)  and 3.4 
(0.53)  mg/dL  at  week  40  and  week  64.  The  baseline  mean  (SD)  RSS  total  
score  was  1.9  (1.17)  in  patients  receiving  burosumab- twza ev  ery two 
weeks.  After  40 weeks  of  treatment  with  burosumab- twza,  mean total  
RSS decreased  from  1.9  to  0.8.  After  40 weeks  of  treatment  with  
burosumab- twza, the m  ean RGI -C  Global  score was  +1.7  in patients 
receiving burosumab-twza  every  two weeks.  Eighteen out  of  26 patients  
achieved an  RGI-C  score  of  ≥  +2.0.  These findings  were  maintained  at  
week  64.  The mean (SD)  serum  total  alkaline phosphatase  activity  was  
462  (110)  U/L  at  baseline  and  decreased  to  354  (73)  U/L  at  Week  64 
 
(-23%,  p  <  0.0001)  in  the  patients  who  received  burosumab-twza  every  2 
weeks. Burosumab- twza treatment for  64 weeks increased s  tanding 
mean  (SD)  height  Z  score  from  -1.72  (1.03)  at  baseline  to  -1.54  (1.13)  in 
the patients  who received burosumab-twza  every  two  weeks  (LS mean 
change of  +0.19 (95%  CI:  0.09 to  0.29).

Study 2 (NCT 02750618) was a 64-week open-label study in 13 pediatric 
XLH patients, 1 to 4 years old. Patients received burosumab-twza at a 
dose of 0.8 mg/kg every two weeks with titration up to 1.2 mg/kg based 
on serum phosphorus measurements. All patients completed at least 40 weeks on study; no patients discontinued. At study entry, the mean age of 
patients was 2.9 years and 69% were male. All patients had radiographic 
evidence of rickets at baseline and had received oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogs for a mean (SD) duration of 16.9 (13.9) months. 
Oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogs were discontinued prior to study enrollment. Burosumab-twza increased mean (SD) serum 
phosphorus levels from 2.5 (0.28) mg/dL at baseline to 3.5 (0.49) mg/dL at week 40. Baseline mean (SD) total RSS was 2.9 (1.37) in 13 patients. 
After 40 weeks of treatment with burosumab- twza, mean total RSS 
decreased from 2.9 to 1.2 and the mean (SE) RGI-C Global score was 
+2.3 (0.08). All 13 patients achieved a RGI-C global score ≥ +2.0. The 
mean (SE) lower limb deformity as assessed by RGI -C, using standing 
long leg radiographs, was +1.3 (0.14). The mean (SD) serum total alkaline phosphatase activity was 549 (194) U/L at baseline and decreased to 335 (88) U/L at Week 40 (mean change: -36%). 
Study  3  (NCT  02526160)  was  a  random
 ized,  double- blind,  placebo-  
controlled study  in  134 adult  XLH  patients.  The  study  comprised a  24- 
week  placebo- controlled treatment  phase.  Burosumab- twza was 
administered at  a dose  of  1  mg/kg every  4  weeks.  At  study  entry,  the 
mean  age  of  patients  was  40  years  (range  19  to  66  years)  and  35%  were 
male.  All  patients  had  skeletal  pain  associated  with  XLH/osteomalacia  at 
baseline.  The  baseline  mean  (SD)  serum  phosphorus  concentration  was 
below  the  lower  limit  of  normal  at  1.98  (0.31)  mg/dL.  Oral  phosphate  and 
active  vitamin  D  analogs  were  not  allowed during  the study.  One patient  
in the bur  osumab- twza  group discontinued  treatment.  At  baseline,  mean 
(SD) serum  phosphorus  was 1.9  (0.32)  and 2.0 (0.30)  mg/dL  in  the 
placebo  and burosumab- twza  groups  respectivel y.  During the initial 24 
weeks  of  treatment,  mean (SD)  serum  phosphorus  across  the  midpoints  
of  dose  intervals  (2  weeks  post  dose)  was  2.1  (0.30)  and  3.2  (0.53)  mg/dL 
in  the  placebo and burosumab-twza  groups,  and mean  (SD)  serum  
phosphorus  across  the  ends of  dose  intervals  was  2.0 (0.30)  and 2.7 
(0.45)  mg/dL in the placebo and burosumab- twza  groups.  A total  of  94%  
of  patients  treated  with  burosumab-twza  achieved  a serum  phosphorus  
level  above  the  lower  limit  of  normal  (LLN)  compared  to  8%  in  the

placebo group through week 24. At baseline, the mean (SD) ratio of renal 
tubular maximum reabsorption rate of phosphate to glomerular filtration 
rate (TmP/GFR) was 1.60 (0.37) and 1.68 (0.40) mg/dL in the placebo and burosumab- twza groups respectively. At week 22 (midpoint of a dose 
interval), mean (SD) TmP/GFR was 1.69 (0.37) and 2.73 (0.75) mg/dL in 
the placebo and burosumab- twza groups. At week 24 (end of a dose 
interval), mean (SD) TmP/GFR was 1.73 (0.42) and 2.21 (0.48) mg/dL in 
the placebo and burosumab- twza groups. A skeletal survey was 
conducted at baseline to identify osteomalacia -related fractures and 
pseudofractures. Osteomalacia -related fractures are defined as 
atraumatic lucencies extending across both bone cortices and 
pseudofractures are defined as atraumatic lucencies extending across one cortex. There were 52% of patients who had either active (unhealed) 
fractures (12%) or active pseudofractures (47%) at baseline. The active fractures and pseudofrac tures were predominantly located in the femurs, 
tibia/fibula, and metatarsals of the feet. Assessment of these active fracture/pseudofracture sites at week 24 demonstrated a higher rate of complete healing in the burosumab-twza group compared to placebo. 
During treatment through week 24, a total of 6 new fractures or pseudofractures appeared in 68patients receiving burosumab- twza, 
compared to 8 new abnormalities in 66 patients receiving placebo. 
Study 4 (NCT 02537431) was a 48-week, open-label, single -arm study in 
14 adult XLH patients to assess the effects of CRYSVITA on improvement 
of osteomalacia as determined by histologic and histomorphometric evaluation of iliac crest bone biopsies. Patients received 1 mg/kg burosumab- twza every four weeks. At study entry, the mean age of 
patients was 40 years (range 25 to 52 years) and 43% were male. Oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogs were not allowed during the study. After 48 weeks of treatment, healing of osteomalacia was observed 
in ten patients as demonstrated by decreases in Osteoid volume/Bone 
volume (OV/BV) from a mean (SD) score of 26% (12.4) at baseline to 11% (6.5), a change of -57%. Osteoid thickness (O.Th) declined in eleven 
patients from a mean (SD) of 17 (4.1) micrometers to 12 (3.1) micrometers, a change of -33%. Mineralization lag time (MLt) declined in 
6 patients from a mean (SD) of 594 (675) days to 156 (77) days, a

The most common adverse reactions in adults taking burosumab-twza 
were back pain, headache, restless leg syndrome, decreased vitamin D, 
dizziness and constipation. The most common adverse reactions in 
children were headache, injection site reaction, vomiting, decreased vitamin D and pyrexia (fever). Patients taking burosumab-twza may need 
dose interruption and/or dose reduction based on their serum phosphorus 
levels. 
Tumor -induced Osteomalacia (TIO) 
Tumor -induced osteomalacia (TIO), also known as oncogenic 
osteomalacia, is a rare disease characterized by slow -growing tumors 
that release excess levels of FGF23, which suppresses renal tubular phosphate reabsorption and the renal production of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D. This acquired paraneoplastic syndrome includes biochemical 
and bone mineralization abnormalities that closely resemble genetic 
forms of hypophosphatemic rickets. Although primarily found in adults, TIO can occur in children and adolescents. Children with TIO present with 
clinical features of rickets, including gait disturbances, growth retardation, 
and skeletal deformities. Burosumab- twza has been found to bind to and 
inhibit the biological activity of FGF23 restoring renal phosphate reabsorption and increasing the serum concentration of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (Park, 2020; Scheinman et al., 2020; Ultragenyx, 2020a). 
In  June 2020,  the  FDA  approv
 ed  Crysvita  (burosumab- twza;  
Ultragenyx) for the treatment  of fibroblast  growth factor  23 ( FGF23) - 
related hy  pophosphatemia in tumor -induced osteomalacia  associated 
with  phosphaturic  mesenchymal tumors that  cannot  be curatively  
resected or  localized  in  patients  aged 2 years  of  age and older.  FDA 
approval  was  based  on data  from  2  single- arm  phase 2  studies  [Study  
1  (NCT02304367)  and  Study  2  (NCT02722798)]  that  included  a  total  of 
27 adults  with  TIO who received burosumab-twza  every  4  weeks.  
"Results  from  Study  1  showed that  50%  of  patients  (n=7  out  of  14)  
achieved  normal  phosphate  levels  with  a  mean  (SD)  increase  from  1.60 
(0.47)  mg/dL  at  baseline  to  2.64 (0.76)  mg/dL  through week  24,  which 
were  sustained  near  or  above  the lower  limit  of  normal  (LLN)  through 
week  144.  In  Study  2,  69%  of  patients  (n=9  out  of  13)  achieved  normal  
phosphate  levels  with  a  mean  (SD)  increase  from  1.62  (0.49)  mg/dL  at  
baseline to  2.63 (0.87)  mg/dL through week  24  and were  sustained near

or above the LLN through week 88. Additionally, radiographic evaluation 
of patients in Study 1 showed a reduction in the number of areas of tracer 
uptake with long- term treatment, suggesting healing of bone lesions 
related to osteomalacia. In TIO, increased tracer uptake is presumed to 
be nontraumatic fractures and pseudofractures" (Park, 2020). 
Study 1 (NCT02304367) and Study 2 (NCT02722798) inclusion criteria 
consisted of adult participants having a fasting serum phosphorus level 
less than 2.5 mg/dL, an iFGF23 level greater than or equal to 100 pg/mL 
by Kainos assay, a ratio of renal tubular maximum reabsorption rate of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) less than 2.5 mg/dL, and a clinical diagnosis of TIO/ENS based on evidence of excessive 
FGF23 that is not amenable to cure by surgical excision of the offending 
tumor/lesion (Ultragenyx, 2019, 2020b). 
Safety and effectiveness of Crysvita in pediatric patients 2 years and 
older with TIO are supported by evidence from the studies in adult 
patients with TIO with additional modeling and simulation of PK data from 
adult and pediatric XLH patients and adult TIO patients to inform dosing (Ultragenyx, 2020a). 
Scheinman et al (2020) state that clinical trials of burosumab in adults 
with TIO resulted in improved parameters of osteomalacia as observed in 
bone biopsies following one year of monthly injections. Thus, burosumab 
may be an ideal therapy for the patient with an unresectable TIO tumor or 
one in which localization has not been realized. 
Other Indications 
Fibrous Dysplasia 
Gladding and colleagues (2021) noted that fibrous dysplasia/McCune-
Albright syndrome (FD/MAS) is a rare mosaic disorder of Gαs activation. 
Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) -mediated hypophosphatemia is a 
feature of FD/MAS that has been associated with poor skeletal outcomes. Standard therapy includes oral phosphorus and vitamin D 
analogs; however, treatment is limited by potential adverse renal and 
gastro- intestinal (GI) effects. Burosumab, a monoclonal antibody to 
FGF23, is FDA-approved for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia

(HPP) and TIO. There is currently no safety or efficacy data to support 
burosumab use in patients with FD/MAS. These researchers reported the 
findings of a 7 -year-old boy with severe FD/MAS who presented with 
persistent HPP and skeletal complications despite conventional treatment 
with oral phosphate and calcitriol. He was started on burosumab and achieved sustained normalization of serum phosphorus and marked 
improvement in alkaline phosphatase (APT) levels. This was accompanied by an encouraging clinical response, including decreased bone pain, improved muscle strength, and improved ambulation. No adverse effects of burosumab therapy were observed. The authors 
concluded that this was the first reported case of burosumab treatment in 
a patient with FD/MAS. These researchers stated that the encouraging 
biochemical and clinical response in this patient highlighted the need for future studies to examine the safety and efficacy of burosumab in the 
FD/MAS pediatric population. 
Tyrosinemia Type 1 
Dos Santos and colleagues (2021) stated that the key clinical features of 
tyrosinemia type 1 usually appear in the 1st months of life, including fever, 
diarrhea, vomiting, liver involvement, growth failure, as well as renal 
proximal tubulopathy with subsequent hypophosphatemic rickets. An early diagnosis is crucial in order to provide specific management and to 
prevent complications. These investigators r eported on 2 cases referred 
primarily to pediatric nephrologists for the diagnosis of "neonatal tubulopathy" and management of "X -linked hypophosphatemia (XLH)," 
respectively. The authors emphasized that even a mixed tubulopathy can 
reveal tyrosinemia; and tyrosinemia is a classic differential diagnosis of 
XLH that should not be forgotten, especially in the era of the anti -FGF23 
burosumab. 
Furthermore, an UpToDate review on “Disorders of tyrosine metabolism” 
(Grompe, 2021) does not mention burosumab as a management / therapeutic option.
